<P>This chapter presents a case study in the design of a
"What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get" (or "WYSIWYG") document editor called
<STRONG>Lexi</STRONG>.<A NAME="fn1"></A><A HREF="#footnote1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> We'll
see how design patterns capture solutions to design problems in
Lexi and applications like it. By the end of this chapter you will
have gained experience with eight patterns, learning them by
example.</P>

<A NAME="lexi-userint"></A>
<P><A HREF="#editor_Lexi">Figure 2.1</A> depicts Lexi's user interface.  A
WYSIWYG representation of the document occupies the large rectangular
area in the center.  The document can mix text and graphics freely in
a variety of formatting styles.  Surrounding the document are the
usual pull-down menus and scroll bars, plus a collection of page icons
for jumping to a particular page in the document.</P>

Design Problems</H2>

<A NAME="auto1000"></A>
<P>We will examine seven problems in Lexi's design:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1001"></A>
<LI><EM>Document structure.</EM>
The choice of internal representation for the document affects nearly
every aspect of Lexi's design. All editing, formatting, displaying,
and textual analysis will require traversing the representation. The
way we organize this information will impact the design of the rest of
the application.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1002"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1003"></A>
<LI><EM>Formatting.</EM>
How does Lexi actually arrange text and graphics into lines and
columns?  What objects are responsible for carrying out different
formatting policies?  How do these policies interact with the
document's internal representation?</LI>

<A NAME="auto1004"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1005"></A>
<LI><EM>Embellishing the user interface.</EM>
Lexi's user interface includes scroll bars, borders, and drop shadows
that embellish the WYSIWYG document interface. Such embellishments are
likely to change as Lexi's user interface evolves.  Hence it's
important to be able to add and remove embellishments easily without
affecting the rest of the application.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1006"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="lexi-looknfeel"></A>
<A NAME="present-manage"></A>
<LI><EM>Supporting multiple look-and-feel standards.</EM>
Lexi should adapt easily to different look-and-feel standards
such as Motif and Presentation Manager (PM) without major modification.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1007"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="multiple-windows"></A>
<LI><EM>Supporting multiple window systems.</EM>
Different look-and-feel standards are usually implemented on different
window systems. Lexi's design should be as independent of the window
system as possible.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1008"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1009"></A>
<LI><EM>User operations.</EM>
Users control Lexi through various user interfaces, including
buttons and pull-down menus.  The functionality behind these
interfaces is scattered throughout the objects in the application.
The challenge here is to provide a uniform mechanism both for
accessing this scattered functionality and for undoing its effects.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1010"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1011"></A>
<LI><EM>Spelling checking and hyphenation.</EM>
How does Lexi support analytical operations such as checking for
misspelled words and determining hyphenation points?  How can we
minimize the number of classes we have to modify to add a new
analytical operation?</LI>

</OL>

<A NAME="auto1012"></A>
<P>We discuss these design problems in the sections that follow. Each
problem has an associated set of goals plus constraints on how we
achieve those goals.  We explain the goals and constraints in detail
before proposing a specific solution. The problem and its solution
will illustrate one or more design patterns. The discussion for each
problem will culminate in a brief introduction to the relevant
patterns.</P>

<A NAME="sec2-2"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#sec2-3"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: Formatting"></A>
Document Structure</H2>

<A NAME="editor_sec_document_structure"></A>
<P>A document is ultimately just an arrangement of basic graphical
elements such as characters, lines, polygons, and other shapes. These
elements capture the total information content of the document. Yet an
author often views these elements not in graphical terms but in terms
of the document's physical structure&#151;lines, columns, figures,
tables, and other substructures.<A NAME="fn2"></A><A HREF="#footnote2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
In turn, these substructures have substructures of their
own, and so on.</P>

<A NAME="auto1013"></A>
<P>Lexi's user interface should let users manipulate these
substructures directly. For example, a user should be able to treat a
diagram as a unit rather than as a collection of individual graphical
primitives.  The user should be able to refer to a table as a whole,
not as an unstructured mass of text and graphics. That helps make the
interface simple and intuitive. To give Lexi's implementation
similar qualities, we'll choose an internal representation that
matches the document's physical structure.</P>

<A NAME="auto1014"></A>
<P>In particular, the internal representation should support the
following:</P>

<UL>

<A NAME="auto1015"></A>
<LI>Maintaining the document's physical structure, that is, the
arrangement of text and graphics into lines, columns, tables, etc.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1016"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1017"></A>
<LI>Generating and presenting the document visually.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1018"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1019"></A>
<LI>Mapping positions on the display to elements in the internal
representation. This lets Lexi determine what the user is
referring to when he points to something in the visual representation.</LI>

</UL>

<A NAME="auto1020"></A>
<P>In addition to these goals are some constraints. First, we should
treat text and graphics uniformly. The application's interface lets
the user embed text within graphics freely and vice versa.  We should
avoid treating graphics as a special case of text or text as a special
case of graphics; otherwise we'll end up with redundant formatting and
manipulation mechanisms.  One set of mechanisms should suffice for
both text and graphics.</P>

<A NAME="auto1021"></A>
<P>Second, our implementation shouldn't have to distinguish between
single elements and groups of elements in the internal representation.
Lexi should be able to treat simple and complex elements
uniformly, thereby allowing arbitrarily complex documents. The tenth
element in line five of column two, for instance, could be a single
character or an intricate diagram with many subelements. As long as we
know this element can draw itself and specify its dimensions, its
complexity has no bearing on how and where it should appear on the
page.</P>

<A NAME="auto1022"></A>
<P>Opposing the second constraint, however, is the need to analyze the
text for such things as spelling errors and potential hyphenation
points. Often we don't care whether the element of a line is a simple
or complex object. But sometimes an analysis depends on the objects
being analyzed. It makes little sense, for example, to check the
spelling of a polygon or to hyphenate it. The internal
representation's design should take this and other potentially
conflicting constraints into account.</P>

<A NAME="recursivecomposition"></A>
<H3>Recursive Composition</H3>

<A NAME="auto1023"></A>
<P>A common way to represent hierarchically structured information is
through a technique called <STRONG>recursive composition</STRONG>, which
entails building increasingly complex elements out of simpler ones.
Recursive composition gives us a way to compose a document out of
simple graphical elements. As a first step, we can tile a set of
characters and graphics from left to right to form a line in the
document. Then multiple lines can be arranged to form a column,
multiple columns can form a page, and so on (see
<A HREF="#editor_recursive_composition">Figure 2.2</A>).

<A NAME="editor_recursive_composition"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/textcomp.gif"><BR><BR>
Figure 2.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;Recursive composition of text and graphics</P>

<A NAME="auto1024"></A>
<P>We can represent this physical structure by devoting an object to each
important element.  That includes not just the visible elements like
the characters and graphics but the invisible, structural elements as
well&#151;the lines and the column. The result is the object structure
shown in <A HREF="#editor_object_structure">Figure 2.3</A>.</P>

<A NAME="editor_object_structure"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/texts008.gif"><BR><BR>
Figure 2.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;Object structure for recursive composition of
text and graphics</P>

<A NAME="auto1025"></A>
<P>By using an object for each character and graphical element in the
document, we promote flexibility at the finest levels of Lexi's
design. We can treat text and graphics uniformly with respect to how
they are drawn, formatted, and embedded within each other. We can
extend Lexi to support new character sets without disturbing other
functionality. Lexi's object structure mimics the document's
physical structure.</P>

<A NAME="auto1026"></A>
<P>This approach has two important implications. The first is obvious:
The objects need corresponding classes. The second implication, which
may be less obvious, is that these classes must have compatible
interfaces, because we want to treat the objects uniformly. The way to
make interfaces compatible in a language like C++ is to relate the
classes through inheritance.</P>

<A NAME="section_glyphs"></A>
<H3>Glyphs</H3>

<A NAME="auto1027"></A>
<P>We'll define a <STRONG>Glyph</STRONG> abstract class for all
objects that can appear in a document structure.<A NAME="fn3"></A><A
HREF="#footnote3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> Its subclasses define both
primitive graphical elements (like characters and images) and
structural elements (like rows and columns).  <A HREF="#editor_glyph_class_hierarchy">Figure 2.4</A> depicts a representative part

</CENTER>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Table 2.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic glyph interface</P>

<A NAME="auto1029"></A>
<P>Glyphs have three basic responsibilities.  They know (1) how to draw
themselves, (2) what space they occupy, and (3) their children and
parent.</P>

<A NAME="window"></A>
<P>Glyph subclasses redefine the <CODE>Draw</CODE> operation to render
themselves onto a window. They are passed a reference to a <CODE>Window</CODE>
object in the call to <CODE>Draw</CODE>. The <STRONG>Window</STRONG> class defines
graphics operations for rendering text and basic shapes in a window on the
screen.  A <STRONG>Rectangle</STRONG> subclass of Glyph might redefine
<CODE>Draw</CODE> as follows:</P>

<A NAME="auto1030"></A>
<PRE>
    void Rectangle::Draw (Window* w) {
        w->DrawRect(_x0, _y0, _x1, _y1);
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1031"></A>
<P>where <CODE>_x0</CODE>, <CODE>_y0</CODE>, <CODE>_x1</CODE>, and <CODE>_y1</CODE>
are data members of <CODE>Rectangle</CODE> that define two opposing corners of
the rectangle.  <CODE>DrawRect</CODE> is the Window operation that makes
the rectangle appear on the screen.

<A NAME="auto1032"></A>
<P>A parent glyph often needs to know how much space a child glyph occupies,
for example, to arrange it and other glyphs in a line so that none overlaps
(as shown in <A HREF="#editor_object_structure">Figure 2.3</A>). The
<CODE>Bounds</CODE> operation returns the rectangular area that the glyph
occupies. It returns the opposite corners of the smallest rectangle that
contains the glyph. Glyph subclasses redefine this operation to return the
rectangular area in which they draw.</P>

<A NAME="auto1033"></A>
<P>The <CODE>Intersects</CODE> operation returns whether a specified point
intersects the glyph.  Whenever the user clicks somewhere in the
document, Lexi calls this operation to determine which glyph or
glyph structure is under the mouse.  The Rectangle class redefines
this operation to compute the intersection of the rectangle and the
given point.</P>

<A NAME="auto1034"></A>
<P>Because glyphs can have children, we need a common interface to
add, remove, and access those children. For example, a Row's children
are the glyphs it arranges into a row. The <CODE>Insert</CODE>
operation inserts a glyph at a position specified by an integer
index.<A NAME="fn5"></A><A HREF="#footnote5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> The <CODE>Remove</CODE>
operation removes a specified glyph if it is indeed a child.</P>

<A NAME="auto1035"></A>
<P>The <CODE>Child</CODE> operation returns the child (if any) at the given
index. Glyphs like Row that can have children should use <CODE>Child</CODE>
internally instead of accessing the child data structure directly. That way
you won't have to modify operations like <CODE>Draw</CODE> that iterate
through the children when you change the data structure from, say, an array
to a linked list. Similarly, <CODE>Parent</CODE> provides a standard interface
to the glyph's parent, if any. Glyphs in Lexi store a reference to
their parent, and their <CODE>Parent</CODE> operation simply returns this
reference.</P>


<H3>Composite Pattern</H3>

<A NAME="auto1036"></A>
<P>Recursive composition is good for more than just documents. We can use
it to represent any potentially complex, hierarchical structure.  The
<A HREF="pat4cfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Composite (163)</A> pattern captures the essence of
recursive composition in object-oriented terms. Now would be a good
time to turn to that pattern and study it, referring back to this
scenario as needed.</P>

<A NAME="sec2-3"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#sec2-4"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: Embellishing the User Interface"></A>
Formatting</H2>

<A NAME="editor_sec_formatting"></A>
<P>We've settled on a way to <EM>represent</EM> the document's physical
structure. Next, we need to figure out how to construct a <EM>particular</EM> physical structure, one that corresponds to a properly
formatted document.  Representation and formatting are distinct: The
ability to capture the document's physical structure doesn't tell us
how to arrive at a particular structure. This responsibility rests
mostly on Lexi. It must break text into lines, lines into columns,
and so on, taking into account the user's higher-level desires. For
example, the user might want to vary margin widths, indentation, and
tabulation; single or double space; and probably many other formatting
constraints.<A NAME="fn6"></A><A HREF="#footnote6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
Lexi's
formatting algorithm must take all of these into account.</P>

<A NAME="auto1037"></A>
<P>By the way, we'll restrict "formatting" to mean breaking a collection of
glyphs into lines. In fact, we'll use the terms "formatting" and
"linebreaking" interchangeably. The techniques we'll discuss apply
equally well to breaking lines into columns and to breaking columns into
pages.</P>


<H3>Encapsulating the Formatting Algorithm</H3>

<A NAME="auto1038"></A>
<P>The formatting process, with all its constraints and details, isn't easy to
automate. There are many approaches to the problem, and people have come up
with a variety of formatting algorithms with different strengths and
weaknesses. Because Lexi is a WYSIWYG editor, an important trade-off to
consider is the balance between formatting quality and formatting speed. We
want generally good response from the editor without sacrificing how good
the document looks. This trade-off is subject to many factors, not all of
which can be ascertained at compile-time. For example, the user might
tolerate slightly slower response in exchange for better formatting. That
trade-off might make an entirely different formatting algorithm more
appropriate than the current one. Another, more implementation-driven
trade-off balances formatting speed and storage requirements: It may be
possible to decrease formatting time by caching more information.</P>

<A NAME="auto1039"></A>
<P>Because formatting algorithms tend to be complex, it's also desirable
to keep them well-contained or&#151;better yet&#151;completely independent
of the document structure. Ideally we could add a new kind of Glyph
subclass without regard to the formatting algorithm. Conversely,
adding a new formatting algorithm shouldn't require modifying existing
glyphs.</P>

<A NAME="auto1040"></A>
<P>These characteristics suggest we should design Lexi so that it's
easy to change the formatting algorithm at least at compile-time, if
not at run-time as well. We can isolate the algorithm and make it
easily replaceable at the same time by encapsulating it in an object.
More specifically, we'll define a separate class hierarchy for objects
that encapsulate formatting algorithms. The root of the hierarchy will
define an interface that supports a wide range of formatting
algorithms, and each subclass will implement the interface to carry
out a particular algorithm. Then we can introduce a Glyph subclass
that will structure its children automatically using a given algorithm
object.</P>

<H3>Compositor and Composition</H3>

<A NAME="auto1041"></A>
<P>We'll define a <STRONG>Compositor</STRONG> class for objects
that can encapsulate a formatting algorithm. The interface (<A HREF="#editor_basic_compositor_interface">Table 2.2</A>) lets
the compositor know <EM>what</EM> glyphs to format and <EM>when</EM>
to do the formatting.  The glyphs it formats are the children of
a special Glyph subclass called <STRONG>Composition</STRONG>. A
composition gets an instance of a Compositor subclass (specialized
for a particular linebreaking algorithm) when it is created, and
it tells the compositor to <CODE>Compose</CODE> its glyphs when
necessary, for example, when the user changes a document.
<A HREF="#editor_composition_and_compositor_class_relationships">Figure 2.5</A>
depicts the relationships between the Composition and Compositor classes.</P>

Figure 2.5:&nbsp;&nbsp;Composition and Compositor class relationships</P>

<A NAME="auto1045"></A>
<P>An unformatted Composition object contains only the visible
glyphs that make up the document's basic content. It doesn't contain
glyphs that determine the document's physical structure, such as
Row and Column.  The composition is in this state just after it's
created and initialized with the glyphs it should format.  When
the composition needs formatting, it calls its compositor's
<CODE>Compose</CODE> operation. The compositor in turn iterates
through the composition's children and inserts new Row and Column
glyphs according to its linebreaking algorithm.<A NAME="fn7"></A><A
HREF="#footnote7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> <A HREF="#editor_compositor_object_structure">Figure 2.6</A> shows the resulting object

<A NAME="document-color"></A>
<A NAME="simple-compositor"></A>
<A NAME="tex"></A>
<P>Each Compositor subclass can implement a different linebreaking algorithm.
For example, a SimpleCompositor might do a quick pass without regard for
such esoterica as the document's "color." Good color means having an even
distribution of text and whitespace. A TeXCompositor would implement the
full TeX algorithm [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#tex" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Knu84</A>], which takes things like color into account
in exchange for longer formatting times.</P>

<A NAME="auto1046"></A>
<P>The Compositor-Composition class split ensures a strong separation
between code that supports the document's physical structure and the
code for different formatting algorithms. We can add new Compositor
subclasses without touching the glyph classes, and vice versa. In
fact, we can change the linebreaking algorithm at run-time by adding a
single <CODE>SetCompositor</CODE> operation to Composition's basic glyph
interface.</P>

<A NAME="strat-lexi"></A>
<H3>Strategy Pattern</H3>

<A NAME="auto1047"></A>
<P>Encapsulating an algorithm in an object is the intent of the
<A HREF="pat5ifs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Strategy (315)</A> pattern. The key participants in the
pattern are Strategy objects (which encapsulate different algorithms)
and the context in which they operate.  Compositors are strategies;
they encapsulate different formatting algorithms. A composition is the
context for a compositor strategy.</P>

<A NAME="auto1048"></A>
<P>The key to applying the Strategy pattern is designing interfaces for
the strategy and its context that are general enough to support a
range of algorithms. You shouldn't have to change the strategy or
context interface to support a new algorithm. In our example, the
basic Glyph interface's support for child access, insertion, and
removal is general enough to let Compositor subclasses change the
document's physical structure, regardless of the algorithm they use to
do it. Likewise, the Compositor interface gives compositions whatever
they need to initiate formatting.</P>

<H2><A HREF="#sec2-5"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: Supporting Multiple Look-and-Feel Standards"></A>
Embellishing the User Interface</H2>

<A NAME="auto1049"></A>
<P>We consider two embellishments in Lexi's user interface. The
first adds a border around the text editing area to demarcate the page
of text.  The second adds scroll bars that let the user view different
parts of the page. To make it easy to add and remove these
embellishments (especially at run-time), we shouldn't use inheritance
to add them to the user interface. We achieve the most flexibility
if other user interface objects don't even know the embellishments are
there. That will let us add and remove the embellishments without
changing other classes.</P>

<A NAME="transparentencl"></A>
<H3>Transparent Enclosure</H3>

<A NAME="auto1050"></A>
<P>From a programming point of view, embellishing the user interface involves
extending existing code. Using inheritance to do such extension precludes
rearranging embellishments at run-time, but an equally serious problem is
the explosion of classes that can result from an inheritance-based
approach.</P>

<A NAME="compcomposite"></A>
<P>We could add a border to Composition by subclassing it to yield a
BorderedComposition class.  Or we could add a scrolling interface in
the same way to yield a ScrollableComposition.  If we want both scroll
bars and a border, we might produce a BorderedScrollableComposition,
and so forth. In the extreme, we end up with a class for every
possible combination of embellishments, a solution that quickly
becomes unworkable as the variety of embellishments grows.</P>

<A NAME="auto1051"></A>
<P>Object composition offers a potentially more workable and flexible
extension mechanism.  But what objects do we compose?  Since we know
we're embellishing an existing glyph, we could make the embellishment
itself an object (say, an instance of class <STRONG>Border</STRONG>). That
gives us two candidates for composition, the glyph and the border. The
next step is to decide who composes whom. We could have the border
contain the glyph, which makes sense given that the border will
surround the glyph on the screen. Or we could do the opposite&#151;put
the border into the glyph&#151;but then we must make modifications to the
corresponding Glyph subclass to make it aware of the border. Our first
choice, composing the glyph in the border, keeps the border-drawing
code entirely in the Border class, leaving other classes alone.</P>

<A NAME="auto1052"></A>
<P>What does the Border class look like? The fact that borders have an
appearance suggests they should actually be glyphs; that is, Border
should be a subclass of Glyph. But there's a more compelling reason
for doing this: Clients shouldn't care whether glyphs have borders or
not. They should treat glyphs uniformly. When clients tell a plain,
unbordered glyph to draw itself, it should do so without
embellishment. If that glyph is composed in a border, clients
shouldn't have to treat the border containing the glyph any
differently; they just tell it to draw itself as they told the plain
glyph before. This implies that the Border interface matches the Glyph
interface. We subclass Border from Glyph to guarantee this
relationship.</P>

<A NAME="auto1053"></A>
<P>All this leads us to the concept of <STRONG>transparent enclosure</STRONG>,
which combines the notions of (1) single-child (or
single-<STRONG>component</STRONG>) composition and (2) compatible
interfaces.  Clients generally can't tell whether they're dealing with
the component or its <STRONG>enclosure</STRONG> (i.e., the child's parent),
especially if the enclosure simply delegates all its operations to its
component.  But the enclosure can also <EM>augment</EM> the component's
behavior by doing work of its own before and/or after delegating an
operation.  The enclosure can also effectively add state to the
component.  We'll see how next.</P>

<H3>Monoglyph</H3>

<A NAME="auto1054"></A>
<P>We can apply the concept of transparent enclosure to all glyphs that
embellish other glyphs. To make this concept concrete, we'll define a
subclass of Glyph called <STRONG>MonoGlyph</STRONG> to serve as an abstract
class for "embellishment glyphs," like
Border (see <A HREF="#editor_embellish-omt">Figure 2.7</A>).
MonoGlyph stores a reference to a component and forwards all requests to
it. That makes MonoGlyph totally transparent to clients by default.
For example, MonoGlyph implements the <CODE>Draw</CODE> operation like this:</P>

<A NAME="auto1055"></A>
<PRE>
    void MonoGlyph::Draw (Window* w) {
        _component->Draw(w);
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="editor_embellish-omt"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/embel061.gif"><BR><BR>
Figure 2.7:&nbsp;&nbsp;MonoGlyph class relationships</P>

<A NAME="auto1056"></A>
<P>MonoGlyph subclasses reimplement at least one of these forwarding
operations. <CODE>Border::Draw</CODE>, for instance, first invokes the parent
class operation <CODE>MonoGlyph::Draw</CODE> on the component to let the
component do its part&#151;that is, draw everything but the border. Then
<CODE>Border::Draw</CODE> draws the border by calling a private
operation called <CODE>DrawBorder</CODE>, the details of which we'll
omit:</P>

<A NAME="auto1057"></A>
<PRE>
    void Border::Draw (Window* w) {
        MonoGlyph::Draw(w);
        DrawBorder(w);
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1058"></A>
<P>Notice how <CODE>Border::Draw</CODE> effectively <EM>extends</EM> the parent
class operation to draw the border.  This is in contrast to merely
<EM>replacing</EM> the parent class operation, which would omit the call to
<CODE>MonoGlyph::Draw</CODE>.</P>

<A NAME="scroller"></A>
<P>Another MonoGlyph subclass appears in <A HREF="#editor_embellish-omt">Figure 2.7</A>.
<STRONG>Scroller</STRONG> is a MonoGlyph that draws its component in different
locations based on the positions of two scroll bars, which it adds as
embellishments. When Scroller draws its component, it tells the
graphics system to clip to its bounds. Clipping parts of the component
that are scrolled out of view keeps them from appearing on the screen.</P>

<A NAME="auto1059"></A>
<P>Now we have all the pieces we need to add a border and a scrolling
interface to Lexi's text editing area.  We compose the existing
Composition instance in a Scroller instance to add the scrolling
interface, and we compose that in a Border instance.  The resulting
object structure appears in <A HREF="#editor_embellish">Figure 2.8</A>.</P>

<A NAME="editor_embellish"></A>
<A NAME="Fig-2.8"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/embel060.gif"><BR><BR>
Figure 2.8:&nbsp;&nbsp;Embellished object structure</P>

<A NAME="auto1060"></A>
<P>Note that we can reverse the order of composition, putting the
bordered composition into the Scroller instance.  In that case the
border would be scrolled along with the text, which may or may not be
desirable.  The point is, transparent enclosure makes it easy to
experiment with different alternatives, and it keeps clients free of
embellishment code.</P>

<A NAME="auto1061"></A>
<P>Note also how the border composes one glyph, not two or more. This is
unlike compositions we've defined so far, in which parent objects were
allowed to have arbitrarily many children. Here, putting a border
around something implies that "something" is singular. We could
assign a meaning to embellishing more than one object at a time, but
then we'd have to mix many kinds of composition in with the notion of
embellishment: row embellishment, column embellishment, and so forth.
That won't help us, since we already have classes to do those kinds of
compositions. So it's better to use existing classes for composition
and add new classes to embellish the result. Keeping embellishment
independent of other kinds of composition both simplifies the
embellishment classes and reduces their number. It also keeps us from
replicating existing composition functionality.</P>

<A NAME="dec-patt"></A>
<H3>Decorator Pattern</H3>

<A NAME="auto1062"></A>
<P>The <A HREF="pat4dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Decorator (175)</A> pattern captures class and object
relationships that support embellishment by transparent enclosure.
The term "embellishment" actually has broader meaning than what
we've considered here.  In the Decorator pattern, embellishment refers
to anything that adds responsibilities to an object.  We can think
for example of embellishing an abstract syntax tree with semantic
actions, a finite state automaton with new transitions, or a network
of persistent objects with attribute tags.  Decorator generalizes the
approach we've used in Lexi to make it more widely applicable.

Supporting Multiple Look-and-Feel Standards</H2>

<A NAME="auto1063"></A>
<P>Achieving portability across hardware and software platforms is a
major problem in system design. Retargeting Lexi to a new
platform shouldn't require a major overhaul, or it wouldn't be worth
retargeting. We should make porting as easy as possible.</P>

<A NAME="auto1064"></A>
<P>One obstacle to portability is the diversity of look-and-feel standards,
which are intended to enforce uniformity between applications. These
standards define guidelines for how applications appear and react to the
user. While existing standards aren't that different from each other,
people certainly won't confuse one for the other&#151;Motif applications don't
look and feel exactly like their counterparts on other platforms, and vice
versa. An application that runs on more than one platform must conform to
the user interface style guide on each platform.</P>

<A NAME="auto1065"></A>
<P>Our design goals are to make Lexi conform to multiple existing
look-and-feel standards and to make it easy to add support for new
standards as they (invariably) emerge. We also want our design to
support the ultimate in flexibility: changing Lexi's look and feel
at run-time.</P>


<A NAME="widget"></A>
<H3>Abstracting Object Creation</H3>

<A NAME="auto1066"></A>
<P>Everything we see and interact with in Lexi's user interface is a
glyph composed in other, invisible glyphs like Row and Column. The
invisible glyphs compose visible ones like Button and Character and lay
them out properly. Style guides have much to say about the look and
feel of so-called "widgets," another term for visible glyphs like
buttons, scroll bars, and menus that act as controlling elements in a
user interface.  Widgets might use simpler glyphs such as characters,
circles, rectangles, and polygons to present data.</P>

<A NAME="auto1067"></A>
<P>We'll assume we have two sets of widget glyph classes with which to
implement multiple look-and-feel standards:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1068"></A>
<LI>A set of abstract Glyph subclasses for each category of widget
glyph. For example, an abstract class ScrollBar will augment the basic
glyph interface to add general scrolling operations; Button is an
abstract class that adds button-oriented operations; and so on.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1069"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="present-manage"></A>
<LI>A set of concrete subclasses for each abstract subclass that
implement different look-and-feel standards.  For example, ScrollBar
might have MotifScrollBar and PMScrollBar subclasses that implement
Motif and Presentation Manager-style scroll bars, respectively.</LI>

</OL>

<A NAME="auto1070"></A>
<P>Lexi must distinguish between widget glyphs for different look-and-feel
styles. For example, when Lexi needs to put a button in its interface,
it must instantiate a Glyph subclass for the right style of button
(MotifButton, PMButton, MacButton, etc.).</P>

<A NAME="macintosh1"></A>
<P>It's clear that Lexi's implementation can't do this directly, say,
using a constructor call in C++.  That would hard-code the button of a
particular style, making it impossible to select the style at
run-time.  We'd also have to track down and change every such
constructor call to port Lexi to another platform. And buttons are
only one of a variety of widgets in Lexi's user interface.
Littering our code with constructor calls to specific look-and-feel
classes yields a maintenance nightmare&#151;miss just one, and you could
end up with a Motif menu in the middle of your Mac application.</P>

<A NAME="auto1071"></A>
<P>Lexi needs a way to determine the look-and-feel standard that's being
targeted in order to create the appropriate widgets. Not only must we
avoid making explicit constructor calls; we must also be able to
replace an entire widget set easily. We can achieve both by <EM>abstracting the process of object creation</EM>. An example will
illustrate what we mean.</P>


<H3>Factories and Product Classes</H3>

<A NAME="auto1072"></A>
<P>Normally we might create an instance of a Motif scroll bar glyph with the
following C++ code:</P>

<A NAME="auto1073"></A>
<PRE>
    ScrollBar* sb = new MotifScrollBar;
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1074"></A>
<P>This is the kind of code to avoid if you want to minimize
Lexi's look-and-feel dependencies.  But suppose we
initialize <CODE>sb</CODE> as follows:</P>

<A NAME="auto1075"></A>
<PRE>
    ScrollBar* sb = guiFactory->CreateScrollBar();
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1076"></A>
<P>where <CODE>guiFactory</CODE> is an instance of a
<STRONG>MotifFactory</STRONG> class. <CODE>CreateScrollBar</CODE>
returns a new instance of the proper ScrollBar subclass for the
look and feel desired, Motif in this case. As far as clients are
concerned, the effect is the same as calling the MotifScrollBar
constructor directly. But there's a crucial difference:  There's
no longer anything in the code that mentions Motif by name. The
<CODE>guiFactory</CODE> object abstracts the process of creating
not just Motif scroll bars but scroll bars for <EM>any</EM>
look-and-feel standard.  And <CODE>guiFactory</CODE> isn't limited
to producing scroll bars. It can manufacture a full range of widget
glyphs, including scroll bars, buttons, entry fields, menus, and
so forth.</P>

<A NAME="auto1077"></A>
<P>All this is possible because MotifFactory is a subclass of
<STRONG>GUIFactory</STRONG>, an abstract class that defines a
general interface for creating widget glyphs. It includes operations
like <CODE>CreateScrollBar</CODE> and <CODE>CreateButton</CODE>
for instantiating different kinds of widget glyphs. Subclasses of
GUIFactory implement these operations to return glyphs such as
MotifScrollBar and PMButton that implement a particular look and
feel. <A HREF="#editor_factory_hierarchy">Figure 2.9</A> shows
the resulting class hierarchy for <CODE>guiFactory</CODE> objects.</P>

<A NAME="editor_factory_hierarchy"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/facto056.gif"><BR><BR>
Figure 2.9:&nbsp;&nbsp;GUIFactory class hierarchy</P>

<A NAME="productobjects"></A>
<P>We say that factories create <STRONG>product</STRONG> objects.
Moreover, the products that a factory produces are related to one
another; in this case, the products are all widgets for the same
look and feel.  <A HREF="#editor_products">Figure 2.10</A>
shows some of the product classes needed to make factories work
for widget glyphs.</P>

<A NAME="editor_products"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/produ020.gif"><BR><BR>
Figure 2.10:&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract product classes and concrete subclasses</P>

<A NAME="auto1078"></A>
<P>The last question we have to answer is, Where does the <CODE>GUIFactory</CODE>
instance come from?   The answer is, Anywhere that's convenient. The
variable <CODE>guiFactory</CODE> could be a global, a static member of a
well-known class, or even a local variable if the entire user interface is
created within one class or function. There's even a design pattern,
<A HREF="pat3efs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Singleton (127)</A>, for managing well-known, one-of-a-kind
objects like this. The important thing, though, is to initialize
<CODE>guiFactory</CODE> at a point in the program <EM>before</EM> it's ever used
to create widgets but <EM>after</EM> it's clear which look and feel is
desired.</P>

<A NAME="auto1079"></A>
<P>If the look and feel is known at compile-time, then <CODE>guiFactory</CODE>
can be initialized with a simple assignment of a new factory instance
at the beginning of the program:</P>

<A NAME="auto1080"></A>
<PRE>
    GUIFactory* guiFactory = new MotifFactory;
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1081"></A>
<P>If the user can specify the look and feel with a string name at
startup time, then the code to create the factory might be</P>

<A NAME="auto1082"></A>
<PRE>
    GUIFactory* guiFactory;
    const char* styleName = getenv("LOOK_AND_FEEL");
        // user or environment supplies this at startup
    
    if (strcmp(styleName, "Motif") == 0) {
        guiFactory = new MotifFactory;
    
    } else if (strcmp(styleName, "Presentation_Manager") == 0) {
        guiFactory = new PMFactory;
    
    } else {
        guiFactory = new DefaultGUIFactory;
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1083"></A>
<P>There are more sophisticated ways to select the factory at run-time.
For example, you could maintain a registry that maps strings to
factory objects.  That lets you register instances of new factory
subclasses without modifying existing code, as the preceding approach 
requires.  And you don't have to link all platform-specific factories
into the application.  That's important, because it might not be
possible to link a MotifFactory on a platform that doesn't support
Motif.</P>

<A NAME="auto1084"></A>
<P>But the point is that once we've configured the application with the
right factory object, its look and feel is set from then on.  If we
change our minds, we can reinitialize <CODE>guiFactory</CODE> with a
factory for a different look and feel and then reconstruct the
interface.  Regardless of how and when we decide to initialize
<CODE>guiFactory</CODE>, we know that once we do, the application can
create the appropriate look and feel without modification.</P>

<A NAME="absfact"></A>
<H3>Abstract Factory Pattern</H3>

<A NAME="auto1085"></A>
<P>Factories and products are the key participants in the <A HREF="pat3afs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Abstract Factory (87)</A> pattern. This pattern captures how
to create families of related product objects without instantiating
classes directly.  It's most appropriate when the number and general
kinds of product objects stay constant, and there are differences in
specific product families. We choose between families by instantiating
a particular concrete factory and using it consistently to create
products thereafter. We can also swap entire families of products by
replacing the concrete factory with an instance of a different one.
The Abstract Factory pattern's emphasis on <EM>families</EM> of products
distinguishes it from other creational patterns, which involve only one
kind of product object.</P>

<H2><A HREF="#sec2-7"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: User Operations"></A>
Supporting Multiple Window Systems</H2>

<A NAME="auto1086"></A>
<P>Look and feel is just one of many portability issues. Another is the
windowing environment in which Lexi runs. A platform's window system
creates the illusion of multiple overlapping windows on a bitmapped
display. It manages screen space for windows and routes input to them from
the keyboard and mouse. Several important and largely incompatible window
systems exist today (e.g., Macintosh, Presentation Manager, Windows, X).
We'd like Lexi to run on as many of them as possible for exactly the
same reasons we support multiple look-and-feel standards.</P>

<H3>Can We Use an Abstract Factory?</H3>

<A NAME="auto1087"></A>
<P>At first glance this may look like another opportunity to apply the
Abstract Factory pattern. But the constraints for window system portability
differ significantly from those for look-and-feel independence.

<A NAME="auto1088"></A>
<P>In applying the Abstract Factory pattern, we assumed we would define
the concrete widget glyph classes for each look-and-feel standard.
That meant we could derive each concrete product for a particular
standard (e.g., MotifScrollBar and MacScrollBar) from an abstract
product class (e.g., ScrollBar). But suppose we already have several
class hierarchies from different vendors, one for each look-and-feel
standard.  Of course, it's highly unlikely these hierarchies are
compatible in any way.  Hence we won't have a common abstract product
class for each kind of widget (ScrollBar, Button, Menu, etc.)&#151;and the
Abstract Factory pattern won't work without those crucial classes.
We have to make the different widget hierarchies adhere to a common
set of abstract product interfaces.  Only then could we declare the
<CODE>Create...</CODE> operations properly in our abstract factory's
interface.</P>

<A NAME="auto1089"></A>
<P>We solved this problem for widgets by developing our own abstract and
concrete product classes.  Now we're faced with a similar problem when
we try to make Lexi work on existing window systems; namely,
different window systems have incompatible programming interfaces.
Things are a bit tougher this time, though, because we can't afford to
implement our own nonstandard window system.</P>

<A NAME="auto1090"></A>
<P>But there's a saving grace. Like look-and-feel standards, window
system interfaces aren't radically different from one another, because
all window systems do generally the same thing.  We need a uniform set
of windowing abstractions that lets us take different window system
implementations and slide any one of them under a common interface.</P>

<H3>Encapsulating Implementation Dependencies</H3>

<A NAME="auto1091"></A>
<P>In <A HREF="#editor_sec_document_structure">Section 2.2</A>
we introduced a Window class for displaying a glyph or glyph
structure on the display.  We didn't specify the window system that
this object worked with, because the truth is that it doesn't come
from any particular window system. The Window class encapsulates
the things windows tend to do across window systems:</P>

<UL>

<A NAME="auto1092"></A>
<LI>They provide operations for drawing basic geometric shapes.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1093"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1094"></A>
<LI>They can iconify and de-iconify themselves.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1095"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1096"></A>
<LI>They can resize themselves.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1097"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1098"></A>
<LI>They can (re)draw their contents on demand, for example, when they
are de-iconified or when an overlapped and obscured portion of their
screen space is exposed.</LI>

</UL>

<A NAME="auto1099"></A>
<P>The Window class must span the functionality of windows from different
window systems. Let's consider two extreme philosophies:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1100"></A>
<LI><EM>Intersection of functionality.</EM>
The Window class interface provides only functionality that's common
to <EM>all</EM> window systems.  The problem with this approach is that
our Window interface winds up being only as powerful as the least
capable window system. We can't take advantage of more advanced
features even if most (but not all) window systems support them.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1101"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1102"></A>
<LI><EM>Union of functionality.</EM>
Create an interface that incorporates the capabilities of <EM>all</EM>
existing systems. The trouble here is that the resulting interface may
well be huge and incoherent.  Besides, we'll have to change it (and
Lexi, which depends on it) anytime a vendor revises its window
system interface.</LI>

</OL>

<A NAME="auto1103"></A>
<P>Neither extreme is a viable solution, so our design will fall
somewhere between the two.  The Window class will provide a convenient
interface that supports the most popular windowing features. Because
Lexi will deal with this class directly, the Window class must also
support the things Lexi knows about, namely, glyphs.  That means
Window's interface must include a basic set of graphics operations
that lets glyphs draw themselves in the window.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Table 2.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;Window class interface</P>

<A NAME="appwin"></A>
<P>Window is an abstract class. Concrete subclasses of Window support the
different kinds of windows that users deal with. For example,
application windows, icons, and warning dialogs are all windows, but
they have somewhat different behaviors. So we can define subclasses
like ApplicationWindow, IconWindow, and DialogWindow to capture these
differences. The resulting class hierarchy gives applications like
Lexi a uniform and intuitive windowing abstraction, one that doesn't
depend on any particular vendor's window system:</P>

<A NAME="54c"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/windo001.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1106"></A>
<P>Now that we've defined a window interface for Lexi to work with,
where does the real platform-specific window come in? If we're not
implementing our own window system, then at some point our window
abstraction must be implemented in terms of what the target window
system provides. So where does that implementation live?</P>

<A NAME="auto1107"></A>
<P>One approach is to implement multiple versions of the Window class and
its subclasses, one version for each windowing platform. We'd have to
choose the version to use when we build Lexi for a given platform.
But imagine the maintenance headaches we'd have keeping track of
multiple classes, all named "Window" but each implemented on a
different window system.  Alternatively, we could create
implementation-specific subclasses of each class in the Window
hierarchy&#151;and end up with another subclass explosion problem like the one
we had trying to add embellishments.  Both of these alternatives have
another drawback: Neither gives us the flexibility to change the
window system we use after we've compiled the program. So we'll have
to keep several different executables around as well.</P>

<A NAME="encap-var-concept"></A>
<P>Neither alternative is very appealing, but what else can we do? The
same thing we did for formatting and embellishment, namely, <EM>encapsulate the concept that varies</EM>. What varies in this case is the
window system implementation. If we encapsulate a window system's
functionality in an object, then we can implement our Window class and
subclasses in terms of that object's interface. Moreover, if that
interface can serve all the window systems we're interested in, then
we won't have to change Window or any of its subclasses to support
different window systems. We can configure window objects to the
window system we want simply by passing them the right window
system-encapsulating object. We can even configure the window at
run-time.</P>

<A NAME="windowimp"></A>
<A NAME="windowimp-subclass"></A>
<H3>Window and WindowImp</H3>

<A NAME="auto1108"></A>
<P>We'll define a separate <STRONG>WindowImp</STRONG> class hierarchy in which to
hide different window system implementations. WindowImp is an abstract
class for objects that encapsulate window system-dependent code. To make
Lexi work on a particular window system, we configure each window
object with an instance of a WindowImp subclass for that system.  The
following diagram shows the relationship between the Window and WindowImp
hierarchies:</P>

<A NAME="55c"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/windo111.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1109"></A>
<P>By hiding the implementations in WindowImp classes, we avoid polluting
the Window classes with window system dependencies, which keeps the
Window class hierarchy comparatively small and stable. Meanwhile we
can easily extend the implementation hierarchy to support new window
systems.</P>

<H3>WindowImp Subclasses</H3>

<A NAME="auto1110"></A>
<P>Subclasses of WindowImp convert requests into window system-specific
operations. Consider the example we used in
<A HREF="#sec2-2">Section 2.2</A>. We defined the
<CODE>Rectangle::Draw</CODE> in terms of the <CODE>DrawRect</CODE> operation on
the Window instance:</P>

<A NAME="auto1111"></A>
<PRE>
    void Rectangle::Draw (Window* w) {

<P>where <CODE>_imp</CODE> is a member variable of Window that stores the
WindowImp with which the Window is configured.  The window
implementation is defined by the instance of the WindowImp subclass
that <CODE>_imp</CODE> points to.  For an XWindowImp (that is, a
WindowImp subclass for the X Window System), the
<CODE>DeviceRect</CODE>'s implementation might look like

</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1115"></A>
<P><CODE>DeviceRect</CODE> is defined like this because
<CODE>XDrawRectangle</CODE> (the X interface for drawing a rectangle)
defines a rectangle in terms of its lower left corner, its width,
and its height.  <CODE>DeviceRect</CODE> must compute these values
from those supplied.  First it ascertains the lower left corner
(since (<CODE>x0</CODE>, <CODE>y0</CODE>) might be any one
of the rectangle's four corners) and then calculates the width and
height.</P>

<A NAME="path-multiseg-shape"></A>
<A NAME="present-manage2"></A>
<A NAME="xwind-differ"></A>
<P>Why is this so different from the X version? Well, PM doesn't have an
operation for drawing rectangles explicitly as X does. Instead, PM has a
more general interface for specifying vertices of multisegment shapes
(called a <STRONG>path</STRONG>) and for outlining or filling the area they
enclose.</P>

<A NAME="auto1117"></A>
<P>PM's implementation of <CODE>DeviceRect</CODE> is obviously quite
different from X's, but that doesn't matter.  WindowImp hides
variations in window system interfaces behind a potentially large but
stable interface.  That lets Window subclass writers focus on the window
abstraction and not on window system details.  It also lets us add
support for new window systems without disturbing the Window classes.</P>

<H3>Configuring Windows with WindowImps</H3>

<A NAME="auto1118"></A>
<P>A key issue we haven't addressed is how a window gets configured with
the proper WindowImp subclass in the first place.  Stated another way,
when does <CODE>_imp</CODE> get initialized, and who knows what window
system (and consequently which WindowImp subclass) is in use?  The
window will need some kind of WindowImp before it can do anything
interesting.</P>

<A NAME="windowsystfact"></A>
<P>There are several possibilities, but we'll focus on one that uses the
<A HREF="pat3afs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Abstract Factory (87)</A> pattern.  We can define
an abstract factory class WindowSystemFactory that provides an
interface for creating different kinds of window system-dependent
implementation objects:</P>

<A NAME="auto1119"></A>
<PRE>
    class WindowSystemFactory {
    public:
        virtual WindowImp* CreateWindowImp() = 0;
        virtual ColorImp* CreateColorImp() = 0;
        virtual FontImp* CreateFontImp() = 0;
    
        // a "Create..." operation for all window system resources
    };
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1120"></A>
<P>Now we can define a concrete factory for each window system:</P>

<A NAME="auto1121"></A>
<PRE>
    class PMWindowSystemFactory : public WindowSystemFactory {
        virtual WindowImp* CreateWindowImp()
            { return new PMWindowImp; }
        // ...
    };
    
    class XWindowSystemFactory : public WindowSystemFactory {
        virtual WindowImp* CreateWindowImp()
            { return new XWindowImp; }
        // ...
    };
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1122"></A>
<P>The Window base class constructor can use the
<CODE>WindowSystemFactory</CODE> interface to initialize the
<CODE>_imp</CODE> member with the WindowImp that's right for the window
system:</P>

<A NAME="auto1123"></A>
<PRE>
    Window::Window () {
        _imp = windowSystemFactory->CreateWindowImp();
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1124"></A>
<P>The <CODE>windowSystemFactory</CODE> variable is a well-known instance of
a WindowSystemFactory subclass, akin to the well-known
<CODE>guiFactory</CODE> variable defining the look and feel.  The
<CODE>windowSystemFactory</CODE> variable can be initialized in the same
way.</P>

<H3>Bridge Pattern</H3>

<A NAME="auto1125"></A>
<P>The WindowImp class defines an interface to common window system
facilities, but its design is driven by different constraints than
Window's interface.  Application programmers won't deal with
WindowImp's interface directly; they only deal with Window objects.
So WindowImp's interface needn't match the application programmer's
view of the world, as was our concern in the design of the Window
class hierarchy and interface.  WindowImp's interface can more closely
reflect what window systems actually provide, warts and all. It can be
biased toward either an intersection or a union of functionality
approach, whichever suits the target window systems best.</P>

<A NAME="auto1126"></A>
<P>The important thing to realize is that Window's interface caters to
the applications programmer, while WindowImp caters to window systems.
Separating windowing functionality into Window and WindowImp
hierarchies lets us implement and specialize these interfaces
independently. Objects from these hierarchies cooperate to let
Lexi work without modification on multiple window systems.</P>

<A NAME="auto1127"></A>
<P>The relationship between Window and WindowImp is an example of the
<A HREF="pat4bfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Bridge (151)</A> pattern. The intent behind Bridge is to allow
separate class hierarchies to work together even as they evolve
independently. Our design criteria led us to create two separate class
hierarchies, one that supports the logical notion of windows, and
another for capturing different implementations of windows. The Bridge
pattern lets us maintain and enhance our logical windowing
abstractions without touching window system-dependent code, and vice
versa.</P>

User Operations</H2>

<A NAME="auto1128"></A>
<P>Some of Lexi's functionality is available through the document's
WYSIWYG representation.  You enter and delete text, move the insertion
point, and select ranges of text by pointing, clicking, and typing
directly in the document.  Other functionality is accessed indirectly
through user operations in Lexi's pull-down menus, buttons, and
keyboard accelerators.  The functionality includes operations for</P>

<UL>

<A NAME="auto1129"></A>
<LI>creating a new document,

<A NAME="auto1130"></A>
<LI>opening, saving, and printing an existing document,

<A NAME="auto1131"></A>
<LI>cutting selected text out of the document and pasting it back in,

<A NAME="auto1132"></A>
<LI>changing the font and style of selected text,

<A NAME="auto1133"></A>
<LI>changing the formatting of text, such as its alignment and
justification,

<A NAME="auto1134"></A>
<LI>quitting the application,

<A NAME="auto1135"></A>
<LI>and on and on.

</UL>

<A NAME="auto1136"></A>
<P>Lexi provides different user interfaces for these operations.
But we don't want to associate a particular user operation with a
particular user interface, because we may want multiple user
interfaces to the same operation (you can turn the page using either a
page button or a menu operation, for example).  We may also want to
change the interface in the future.</P>

<A NAME="auto1137"></A>
<P>Furthermore, these operations are implemented in many different
classes.  We as implementors want to access their functionality
without creating a lot of dependencies between implementation and user
interface classes.  Otherwise we'll end up with a tightly coupled
implementation, which will be harder to understand, extend, and
maintain.</P>

<A NAME="undo-redo"></A>
<P>To further complicate matters, we want Lexi to support undo and
redo<A NAME="fn8"></A><A HREF="#footnote8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
of
most <EM>but not all</EM> its functionality.  Specifically, we want to be
able to undo document-modifying operations like delete, with which a
user can destroy lots of data inadvertently.  But we shouldn't try to
undo an operation like saving a drawing or quitting the application.
These operations should have no effect on the undo process.  We also
don't want an arbitrary limit on the number of levels of undo and
redo.</P>

<A NAME="auto1138"></A>
<P>It's clear that support for user operations permeates the application.
The challenge is to come up with a simple and extensible mechanism
that satisfies all of these needs.</P>

<A NAME="encap-request"></A>
<H3>Encapsulating a Request</H3>

<A NAME="auto1139"></A>
<P>From our perspective as designers, a pull-down menu is just another
kind of glyph that contains other glyphs.  What distinguishes
pull-down menus from other glyphs that have children is that most
glyphs in menus do some work in response to an up-click.</P>

<A NAME="auto1140"></A>
<P>Let's assume that these work-performing glyphs are instances of a
Glyph subclass called <STRONG>MenuItem</STRONG> and that they do their work in
response to a request from a client.<A NAME="fn9"></A><A HREF="#footnote9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
Carrying out the
request might involve an operation on one object, or many operations
on many objects, or something in between.</P>

<A NAME="auto1141"></A>
<P>We could define a subclass of MenuItem for every user operation and
then hard-code each subclass to carry out the request.  But that's not
really right; we don't need a subclass of MenuItem for each request
any more than we need a subclass for each text string in a pull-down
menu.  Moreover, this approach couples the request to a particular
user interface, making it hard to fulfill the request through a
different user interface.</P>

<A NAME="auto1142"></A>
<P>To illustrate, suppose you could advance to the last page in the
document both through a MenuItem in a pull-down menu <EM>and</EM> by
pressing a page icon at the bottom of Lexi's interface (which might
be more convenient for short documents).  If we associate the request
with a MenuItem through inheritance, then we must do the same for the
page icon and any other kind of widget that might issue such a
request.  That can give rise to a number of classes approaching the
product of the number of widget types and the number of requests.</P>

<A NAME="auto1143"></A>
<P>What's missing is a mechanism that lets us parameterize menu items by
the request they should fulfill.  That way we avoid a proliferation of
subclasses and allow for greater flexibility at run-time.  We could
parameterize MenuItem with a function to call, but that's not a complete
solution for at least three reasons:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1144"></A>
<LI>It doesn't address the undo/redo problem.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1145"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1146"></A>
<LI>It's hard to associate state with a function.  For example, a
function that changes the font needs to know <EM>which</EM> font.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1147"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1148"></A>
<LI>Functions are hard to extend, and it's hard to reuse parts of them.</LI>

</OL>

<A NAME="auto1149"></A>
<P>These reasons suggest that we should parameterize MenuItems with an
<EM>object</EM>, not a function.  Then we can use inheritance to extend
and reuse the request's implementation.  We also have a place to store
state and implement undo/redo functionality.  Here we have another
example of encapsulating the concept that varies, in this case a
request.  We'll encapsulate each request in a <STRONG>command</STRONG>
object.</P>

<H3>Command Class and Subclasses</H3>

<A NAME="auto1150"></A>
<P>First we define a <STRONG>Command</STRONG> abstract class to
provide an interface for issuing a request.  The basic interface
consists of a single abstract operation called "Execute."  Subclasses
of Command implement Execute in different ways to fulfill different
requests.  Some subclasses may delegate part or all of the work to
other objects.  Other subclasses may be in a position to fulfill
the request entirely on their own (see
<A HREF="#editor_partial_command_class_hierarchy">Figure 2.11</A>).
To the requester, however, a Command object is a Command object&#151;they
are treated uniformly.</P>

<A NAME="editor_partial_command_class_hierarchy"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/comma076.gif"><BR><BR>
Figure 2.11:&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial Command class hierarchy</P>

<A NAME="auto1151"></A>
<P>Now MenuItem can store a Command object that encapsulates a
request (<A HREF="#editor_menuitem-command_relationship">Figure 2.12</A>).  We give each menu item object
an instance of the Command subclass that's suitable for that menu
item, just as we specify the text to appear in the menu item.  When
a user chooses a particular menu item, the MenuItem simply calls
Execute on its Command object to carry out the request.  Note that
buttons and other widgets can use commands in the same way menu
items do.</P>

<A NAME="editor_menuitem-command_relationship"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/cmd-m087.gif"><BR><BR>
Figure 2.12:&nbsp;&nbsp;MenuItem-Command relationship</P>

<A NAME="undoability"></A>
<H3>Undoability</H3>

<A NAME="auto1152"></A>
<P>Undo/redo is an important capability in interactive applications.  To
undo and redo commands, we add an Unexecute operation to Command's
interface.  Unexecute reverses the effects of a preceding Execute
operation using whatever undo information Execute stored. In the case
of a FontCommand, for example, the Execute operation would store the
range of text affected by the font change along with the original
font(s).  FontCommand's Unexecute operation would restore the range of
text to its original font(s).</P>

<A NAME="auto1153"></A>
<P>Sometimes undoability must be determined at run-time.  A request to
change the font of a selection does nothing if the text already
appears in that font.  Suppose the user selects some text and then
requests a spurious font change.  What should be the result of a
subsequent undo request?  Should a meaningless change cause the undo
request to do something equally meaningless?  Probably not. If the
user repeats the spurious font change several times, he shouldn't have
to perform exactly the same number of undo operations to get back to
the last meaningful operation.  If the net effect of executing a
command was nothing, then there's no need for a corresponding undo
request.</P>

<A NAME="auto1154"></A>
<P>So to determine if a command is undoable, we add an abstract
Reversible operation to the Command interface.  Reversible returns a
Boolean value.  Subclasses can redefine this operation to return true
or false based on run-time criteria.</P>

<H3>Command History</H3>

<A NAME="auto1155"></A>
<P>The final step in supporting arbitrary-level undo and redo is to
define a <STRONG>command history</STRONG>, or list of commands that have
been executed (or unexecuted, if some commands have been undone).
Conceptually, the command history looks like this:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/cmdhi086.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1156"></A>
<P>Each circle represents a Command object.  In this case the user has
issued four commands.  The leftmost command was issued first, followed
by the second-leftmost, and so on until the most recently issued
command, which is rightmost.  The line marked "present" keeps track
of the most recently executed (and unexecuted) command.</P>

<A NAME="auto1157"></A>
<P>To undo the last command, we simply call Unexecute on the most recent
command:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/cmdhi083.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1158"></A>
<P>After unexecuting the command, we move the "present" line one
command to the left.  If the user chooses undo again, the next-most
recently issued command will be undone in the same way, and we're left
in the state depicted here:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/cmdhi082.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1159"></A>
<P>You can see that by simply repeating this procedure we get multiple
levels of undo.  The number of levels is limited only by the length of
the command history.</P>

<A NAME="auto1160"></A>
<P>To redo a command that's just been undone, we do the same thing in
reverse.  Commands to the right of the present line are commands that
may be redone in the future.  To redo the last undone command, we call
Execute on the command to the right of the present line:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/cmdhi085.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1161"></A>
<P>Then we advance the present line so that a subsequent redo will call
redo on the following command in the future.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/cmdhi084.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1162"></A>
<P>Of course, if the subsequent operation is not another redo but an undo,
then the command to the left of the present line will be undone.  Thus
the user can effectively go back and forth in time as needed to
recover from errors.</P>

<H3>Command Pattern</H3>

<A NAME="auto1163"></A>
<P>Lexi's commands are an application of the
<A HREF="pat5bfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Command (233)</A> pattern, which describes how to
encapsulate a request.  The Command pattern prescribes a uniform
interface for issuing requests that lets you configure clients to
handle different requests.  The interface shields clients from the
request's implementation.  A command may delegate all, part, or none
of the request's implementation to other objects.  This is perfect for
applications like Lexi that must provide centralized access to
functionality scattered throughout the application.  The pattern also
discusses undo and redo mechanisms built on the basic Command
interface.</P>

<A NAME="sec2-8"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#sec2-9"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: Summary"></A>
Spelling Checking and Hyphenation</H2>

<A NAME="auto1164"></A>
<P>The last design problem involves textual analysis, specifically checking
for misspellings and introducing hyphenation points where needed for
good formatting.</P>

<A NAME="auto1165"></A>
<P>The constraints here are similar to those we had for the formatting
design problem in <A HREF="#sec2-3">Section 2.3</A>.
As was the case for linebreaking strategies, there's more than one
way to check spelling and compute hyphenation points.  So here too
we want to support multiple algorithms.  A diverse set of algorithms
can provide a choice of space/time/quality trade-offs.  We should
make it easy to add new algorithms as well.</P>

<A NAME="lexi-doctrav"></A>
<P>We also want to avoid wiring this functionality into the document
structure.  This goal is even more important here than it was in the
formatting case, because spelling checking and hyphenation are just
two of potentially many kinds of analyses we may want Lexi to
support.  Inevitably we'll want to expand Lexi's analytical
abilities over time.  We might add searching, word counting, a
calculation facility for adding up tabular values, grammar checking,
and so forth.  But we don't want to change the Glyph class and all its
subclasses every time we introduce new functionality of this sort.</P>

<A NAME="auto1166"></A>
<P>There are actually two pieces to this puzzle: (1) accessing the
information to be analyzed, which we have scattered over the glyphs
in the document structure, and (2) doing the analysis.  We'll look at
these two pieces separately.</P>

<H3>Accessing Scattered Information</H3>

<A NAME="auto1167"></A>
<P>Many kinds of analysis require examining the text character by
character.  The text we need to analyze is scattered throughout a
hierarchical structure of glyph objects.  To examine text in such a
structure, we need an access mechanism that has knowledge about the
data structures in which objects are stored.  Some glyphs might store
their children in linked lists, others might use arrays, and still
others might use more esoteric data structures.  Our access mechanism
must be able to handle all of these possibilities.</P>

<A NAME="auto1168"></A>
<P>An added complication is that different analyses access information in
different ways.  <EM>Most</EM> analyses will traverse the text from
beginning to end.  But some do the opposite&#151;a reverse search, for
example, needs to progress through the text backward rather than
forward.  Evaluating algebraic expressions could require an inorder
traversal.</P>

<A NAME="auto1169"></A>
<P>So our access mechanism must accommodate differing data structures, and
we must support different kinds of traversals, such as preorder,
postorder, and inorder.</P>

<H3>Encapsulating Access and Traversal</H3>

<A NAME="auto1170"></A>
<P>Right now our glyph interface uses an integer index to let clients
refer to children.  Although that might be reasonable for glyph classes
that store their children in an array, it may be inefficient for
glyphs that use a linked list.  An important role of the glyph
abstraction is to hide the data structure in which children are
stored.  That way we can change the data structure a glyph class uses
without affecting other classes.</P>

<A NAME="auto1171"></A>
<P>Therefore only the glyph can know the data structure it uses.  A
corollary is that the glyph interface shouldn't be biased toward one
data structure or another.  It shouldn't be better suited to arrays
than to linked lists, for example, as it is now.</P>

<A NAME="glyph-trav"></A>
<P>We can solve this problem and support several different kinds of
traversals at the same time.  We can put multiple access and traversal
capabilities directly in the glyph classes and provide a way to choose
among them, perhaps by supplying an enumerated constant as a
parameter.  The classes pass this parameter around during a traversal
to ensure they're all doing the same kind of traversal.  They have to
pass around any information they've accumulated during traversal.</P>

<A NAME="auto1172"></A>
<P>We might add the following abstract operations to Glyph's interface to
support this approach:</P>

<A NAME="auto1173"></A>
<PRE>
    void First(Traversal kind)
    void Next()
    bool IsDone()
    Glyph* GetCurrent()
    void Insert(Glyph*)
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1174"></A>
<P>Operations <CODE>First</CODE>, <CODE>Next</CODE>, and <CODE>IsDone</CODE>
control the traversal.  <CODE>First</CODE> initializes the traversal.  It
takes the kind of traversal as a parameter of type
<CODE>Traversal</CODE>, an enumerated constant with values
such as <CODE>CHILDREN</CODE> (to traverse the glyph's immediate children
only), <CODE>PREORDER</CODE> (to traverse the entire structure in
preorder), <CODE>POSTORDER</CODE>, and <CODE>INORDER</CODE>.
<CODE>Next</CODE> advances to the next glyph in the traversal, and
<CODE>IsDone</CODE> reports whether the traversal is over or not.
<CODE>GetCurrent</CODE> replaces the
<CODE>Child</CODE> operation; it accesses the current glyph in the
traversal.  <CODE>Insert</CODE> replaces the old operation; it inserts
the given glyph at the current position.

An analysis would use the following C++ code to do a preorder
traversal of a glyph structure rooted at <CODE>g</CODE>:

<A NAME="auto1175"></A>
<PRE>
    Glyph* g;
    
    for (g->First(PREORDER); !g->IsDone(); g->Next()) {
        Glyph* current = g->GetCurrent();
    
        // do some analysis
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1176"></A>
<P>Notice that we've banished the integer index from the glyph interface.
There's no longer anything that biases the interface toward one kind
of collection or another.  We've also saved clients from having to
implement common kinds of traversals themselves.</P>

<A NAME="auto1177"></A>
<P>But this approach still has problems.  For one thing, it can't support
new traversals without either extending the set of enumerated values
or adding new operations.  Say we wanted to have a variation on preorder
traversal that automatically skips non-textual glyphs.  We'd have to
change the <CODE>Traversal</CODE> enumeration to include something like
<CODE>TEXTUAL_PREORDER</CODE>.</P>

<A NAME="auto1178"></A>
<P>We'd like to avoid changing existing declarations.
Putting the traversal mechanism entirely in the Glyph class hierarchy
makes it hard to modify or extend without changing lots of classes.
It's also difficult to reuse the mechanism to traverse other kinds of
object structures.  And we can't have more than one traversal in
progress on a structure.</P>

<A NAME="auto1179"></A>
<P>Once again, a better solution is to encapsulate the concept that
varies, in this case the access and traversal mechanisms.  We can
introduce a class of objects called <STRONG>iterators</STRONG> whose sole
purpose is to define different sets of these mechanisms.  We can use
inheritance to let us access different data structures uniformly and
support new kinds of traversals as well.  And we won't have to change
glyph interfaces or disturb existing glyph implementations to do it.</P>

<H3>Iterator Class and Subclasses</H3>

<A NAME="preorderiterator"></A>
<P>We'll use an abstract class called <STRONG>Iterator</STRONG> to
define a general interface for access and traversal.  Concrete
subclasses like <STRONG>ArrayIterator</STRONG> and
<STRONG>ListIterator</STRONG> implement the interface to provide
access to arrays and lists, while <STRONG>PreorderIterator</STRONG>,
<STRONG>PostorderIterator</STRONG>, and the like implement different
traversals on specific structures.  Each Iterator subclass has a
reference to the structure it traverses.  Subclass instances are
initialized with this reference when they are created.
<A HREF="#editor_iterator-omt">Figure 2.13</A> illustrates the
Iterator class along with several subclasses.  Notice that we've
added a CreateIterator abstract operation to the Glyph class
interface to support iterators.</P>

<A NAME="editor_iterator-omt"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/itera037.gif"><BR><BR>
Figure 2.13:&nbsp;&nbsp;Iterator class and subclasses</P>

<A NAME="auto1180"></A>
<P>The Iterator interface provides operations First, Next, and IsDone for
controlling the traversal.  The ListIterator class implements First to
point to the first element in the list, and Next advances the iterator
to the next item in the list.  IsDone returns whether or not the list
pointer points beyond the last element in the list.  CurrentItem
dereferences the iterator to return the glyph it points to.  An
<CODE>ArrayIterator</CODE> class would do similar things but on an
array of glyphs.</P>

<A NAME="auto1181"></A>
<P>Now we can access the children of a glyph structure without knowing
its representation:</P>

<A NAME="auto1182"></A>
<PRE>
    Glyph* g;
    Iterator&lt;Glyph*>* i = g->CreateIterator();
    
    for (i->First(); !i->IsDone(); i->Next()) {
        Glyph* child = i->CurrentItem();
    
        // do something with current child
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1183"></A>
<P>CreateIterator returns a NullIterator instance by default.  A
NullIterator is a degenerate iterator for glyphs that have no
children, that is, leaf glyphs.  NullIterator's IsDone operation
always returns true.</P>

<A NAME="auto1184"></A>
<P>A glyph subclass that has children will override CreateIterator to
return an instance of a different Iterator subclass.  <EM>Which</EM>
subclass depends on the structure that stores the children.  If the
Row subclass of Glyph stores its children in a list
<CODE>_children</CODE>, then its CreateIterator operation would look
like this:</P>

<A NAME="auto1185"></A>
<PRE>
    Iterator&lt;Glyph*>* Row::CreateIterator () {
        return new ListIterator&lt;Glyph*>(_children);
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1186"></A>
<P>Iterators for preorder and inorder traversals implement their
traversals in terms of glyph-specific iterators.  The iterators for
these traversals are supplied the root glyph in the structure they
traverse.  They call CreateIterator on the glyphs in the structure and
use a stack to keep track of the resulting iterators.</P>

<A NAME="pre-iter-mem-func"></A>
<P>For example, class <CODE>PreorderIterator</CODE> gets the iterator from
the root glyph, initializes it to point to its first element, and then
pushes it onto the stack:</P>

<A NAME="auto1187"></A>
<PRE>
    void PreorderIterator::First () {
        Iterator&lt;Glyph*>* i = _root->CreateIterator();
    
        if (i) {
            i->First();
            _iterators.RemoveAll();
            _iterators.Push(i);
        }
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1188"></A>
<P><CODE>CurrentItem</CODE> would simply call <CODE>CurrentItem</CODE> on the
iterator at the top of the stack:</P>

<A NAME="auto1189"></A>
<PRE>
    Glyph* PreorderIterator::CurrentItem () const {
        return
            _iterators.Size() &gt; 0 ?
            _iterators.Top()->CurrentItem() : 0;
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1190"></A>
<P>The <CODE>Next</CODE> operation gets the top iterator on the stack and
asks its current item to create an iterator, in an effort to descend
the glyph structure as far as possible (this is a preorder
traversal, after all).  <CODE>Next</CODE> sets the new iterator to the
first item in the traversal and pushes it on the stack.  Then
<CODE>Next</CODE> tests the latest iterator; if its <CODE>IsDone</CODE>
operation returns true, then we've finished traversing the current
subtree (or leaf) in the traversal.  In that case, <CODE>Next</CODE> pops
the top iterator off the stack and repeats this process until it finds
the next incomplete traversal, if there is one; if not, then we have
finished traversing the structure.</P>

<A NAME="auto1191"></A>
<PRE>
    void PreorderIterator::Next () {
        Iterator&lt;Glyph*>* i =
            _iterators.Top()->CurrentItem()->CreateIterator();
        
        i->First();
        _iterators.Push(i);

        while (
            _iterators.Size() > 0 &amp;&amp; _iterators.Top()->IsDone()
        ) {
            delete _iterators.Pop();
            _iterators.Top()->Next();
        }
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1192"></A>
<P>Notice how the Iterator class hierarchy lets us add new kinds of
traversals without modifying glyph classes&#151;we simply subclass
<CODE>Iterator</CODE> and add a new traversal as we have with
<CODE>PreorderIterator</CODE>.  Glyph subclasses use the same
interface to give clients access to their children without revealing
the underlying data structure they use to store them.  Because
iterators store their own copy of the state of a traversal, we can
carry on multiple traversals simultaneously, even on the same
structure.  And though our traversals have been over glyph structures
in this example, there's no reason we can't parameterize a class like
<CODE>PreorderIterator</CODE> by the type of object in the structure.
We'd use templates to do that in C++.  Then we can reuse the machinery
in <CODE>PreorderIterator</CODE> to traverse other structures.</P>

<H3>Iterator Pattern</H3>

<A NAME="auto1193"></A>
<P>The <A HREF="pat5dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Iterator (257)</A> pattern captures these techniques
for supporting access and traversal over object structures.  It's
applicable not only to composite structures but to collections as
well.  It abstracts the traversal algorithm and shields clients from
the internal structure of the objects they traverse.  The Iterator
pattern illustrates once more how encapsulating the concept that
varies helps us gain flexibility and reusability.  Even so, the
problem of iteration has surprising depth, and the Iterator pattern
covers many more nuances and trade-offs than we've considered here.</P>

<H3>Traversal versus Traversal Actions</H3>

<A NAME="auto1194"></A>
<P>Now that we have a way of traversing the glyph structure, we need to
check the spelling and do the hyphenation.  Both analyses involve
accumulating information during the traversal.</P>

<A NAME="auto1195"></A>
<P>First we have to decide where to put the responsibility for analysis.
We could put it in the Iterator classes, thereby making analysis an
integral part of traversal.  But we get more flexibility and potential
for reuse if we distinguish between the traversal and the actions
performed during traversal.  That's because different analyses often
require the same kind of traversal.  Hence we can reuse the same set
of iterators for different analyses.  For example, preorder traversal
is common to many analyses, including spelling checking, hyphenation,
forward search, and word count.</P>

<A NAME="auto1196"></A>
<P>So analysis and traversal should be separate.  Where else can we put
the responsibility for analysis?  We know there are many kinds of
analyses we might want to do.  Each analysis will do different things
at different points in the traversal.  Some glyphs are more
significant than others depending on the kind of analysis.  If we're
checking spelling or hyphenating, we want to consider character glyphs
and not graphical ones like lines and bitmapped images.  If we're
making color separations, we'd want to consider visible glyphs and not
invisible ones.  Inevitably, different analyses will analyze different
glyphs.</P>

<A NAME="auto1197"></A>
<P>Therefore a given analysis must be able to distinguish different kinds of
glyphs.  An obvious approach is to put the analytical capability into the
glyph classes themselves.  For each analysis we can add one or more
abstract operations to the Glyph class and have subclasses implement
them in accordance with the role they play in the analysis.</P>

<A NAME="auto1198"></A>
<P>But the trouble with that approach is that we'll have to change every
glyph class whenever we add a new kind of analysis.  We can ease this
problem in some cases: If only a few classes participate in the
analysis, or if most classes do the analysis the same way, then we can supply
a default implementation for the abstract operation in the Glyph
class.  The default operation would cover the common case.  Thus we'd
limit changes to just the Glyph class and those subclasses that deviate
from the norm.</P>

<A NAME="auto1199"></A>
<P>Yet even if a default implementation reduces the number of changes, an
insidious problem remains: Glyph's interface expands with every new
analytical capability.  Over time the analytical operations will start
to obscure the basic Glyph interface.  It becomes hard to see that a
glyph's main purpose is to define and structure objects that have
appearance and shape&#151;that interface gets lost in the noise.</P>

<A NAME="section_encapsulating_the_analysis"></A>
<H3>Encapsulating the Analysis</H3>

<A NAME="auto1200"></A>
<P>From all indications, we need to encapsulate the analysis in a
separate object, much like we've done many times before.  We could put
the machinery for a given analysis into its own class.  We could use
an instance of this class in conjunction with an appropriate iterator.
The iterator would "carry" the instance to each glyph in the
structure.  The analysis object could then perform a piece of the
analysis at each point in the traversal.  The analyzer accumulates
information of interest (characters in this case) as the traversal
proceeds:</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/visit002.gif"></P>

<A NAME="spellcheck"></A>
<P>The fundamental question with this approach is how the analysis object
distinguishes different kinds of glyphs without resorting to type
tests or downcasts.  We don't want a <CODE>SpellingChecker</CODE> class
to include (pseudo)code like</P>

<A NAME="auto1201"></A>
<PRE>
    void SpellingChecker::Check (Glyph* glyph) {
        Character* c;
        Row* r;
        Image* i;
    
        if (c = dynamic_cast&lt;Character*>(glyph)) {
            // analyze the character
    
        } else if (r = dynamic_cast&lt;Row*>(glyph)) {
            // prepare to analyze r's children
    
        } else if (i = dynamic_cast&lt;Image*>(glyph)) {
            // do nothing
        }
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1202"></A>
<P>This code is pretty ugly.  It relies on fairly esoteric capabilities
like type-safe casts.  It's hard to extend as well.  We'll have to
remember to change the body of this function whenever we change the
Glyph class hierarchy.  In fact, this is the kind of code that
object-oriented languages were intended to eliminate.</P>

<A NAME="auto1203"></A>
<P>We want to avoid such a brute-force approach, but how?  Let's consider
what happens when we add the following abstract operation to the Glyph
class:</P>

<A NAME="auto1204"></A>
<PRE>
    void CheckMe(SpellingChecker&amp;)
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1205"></A>
<P>We define <CODE>CheckMe</CODE> in every Glyph subclass as follows:</P>

<A NAME="auto1206"></A>
<PRE>
    void GlyphSubclass::CheckMe (SpellingChecker&amp; checker) {
        checker.CheckGlyphSubclass(this);
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1207"></A>
<P>where <CODE>GlyphSubclass</CODE> would be replaced by the name of the
glyph subclass.  Note that when <CODE>CheckMe</CODE> is called, the
specific Glyph subclass is known&#151;after all, we're in one of its
operations.  In turn, the
<CODE>SpellingChecker</CODE> class interface includes an operation like
<CODE>CheckGlyphSubclass</CODE> for every Glyph
subclass<A NAME="fn10"></A><A HREF="#footnote10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>:</P>

<P><CODE>SpellingChecker</CODE>'s checking operation for
<CODE>Character</CODE> glyphs might look something like this:</P>

    void SpellingChecker::CheckCharacter (Character* c) {
        const char ch = c->GetCharCode();

            // append alphabetic character to _currentWord
    
        } else {
            // we hit a nonalphabetic character
    
            if (IsMisspelled(_currentWord)) {
                // add _currentWord to _misspellings
                _misspellings.Append(strdup(_currentWord));
            }

    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1211"></A>
<P>Notice we've defined a special <CODE>GetCharCode</CODE> operation on
just the <CODE>Character</CODE> class.  The spelling checker can deal with
subclass-specific operations without resorting to type tests or
casts&#151;it lets us treat objects specially.</P>

<A NAME="auto1212"></A>
<P><CODE>CheckCharacter</CODE> accumulates alphabetic characters
into the <CODE>_currentWord</CODE> buffer.  When it encounters a
nonalphabetic character, such as an underscore, it uses the
<CODE>IsMisspelled</CODE> operation to check the spelling of the
word in <CODE>_currentWord</CODE>.<A NAME="fn11"></A><A
HREF="#footnote11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
If the word is
misspelled, then <CODE>CheckCharacter</CODE> adds the word to the
list of misspelled words.  Then it must clear out the
<CODE>_currentWord</CODE> buffer to ready it for the next word.
When the traversal is over, you can retrieve the list of misspelled
words with the <CODE>GetMisspellings</CODE> operation.</P>

<A NAME="auto1213"></A>
<P>Now we can traverse the glyph structure, calling
<CODE>CheckMe</CODE> on each glyph with the  spelling checker as an argument.
This effectively identifies each glyph to the SpellingChecker and
prompts the checker to do the next increment in the spelling check.</P>

<A NAME="auto1214"></A>

<A NAME="auto1216"></A>
<P>This approach works for finding spelling errors, but how does it help
us support multiple kinds of analysis?  It looks like we have to add
an operation like <CODE>CheckMe(SpellingChecker&amp;)</CODE> to Glyph and
its subclasses whenever we add a new kind of analysis.  That's true if
we insist on an <EM>independent</EM> class for every analysis.  But
there's no reason why we can't give <EM>all</EM> analysis classes the
same interface.  Doing so lets us use them polymorphically.  That
means we can replace analysis-specific operations like
<CODE>CheckMe(SpellingChecker&amp;)</CODE> with an analysis-independent
operation that takes a more general parameter.</P>

<A NAME="visitor-class"></A>

<H3>Visitor Class and Subclasses</H3>

<P>We'll use the term <STRONG>visitor</STRONG> to refer generally to classes
of objects that "visit" other objects during a traversal and do
something appropriate.<A NAME="fn12"></A><A HREF="#footnote12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
In this case we can define a
<CODE>Visitor</CODE> class that defines an abstract interface for
visiting glyphs in a structure.</P>

<PRE>
    class Visitor {

    };
</PRE>

<A NAME="spellcheck-visitor"></A>
<A NAME="visitor"></A>
<P>Concrete subclasses of <CODE>Visitor</CODE> perform different analyses.
For example, we could have a <CODE>SpellingCheckingVisitor</CODE>
subclass for checking spelling, and a <CODE>HyphenationVisitor</CODE>
subclass for hyphenation.  <CODE>SpellingCheckingVisitor</CODE> would
be implemented exactly as we implemented <CODE>SpellingChecker</CODE>
above, except the operation names would reflect the more general
<CODE>Visitor</CODE> interface.  For example,
<CODE>CheckCharacter</CODE> would be called <CODE>VisitCharacter</CODE>.</P>

<A NAME="auto1219"></A>
<P>Since <CODE>CheckMe</CODE> isn't appropriate for visitors that don't
check anything, we'll give it a more general name:</P>
<CODE>Accept</CODE>.  Its argument must also change to take a
<CODE>Visitor&amp;</CODE>, reflecting the fact that it can accept any visitor.
Now adding a new analysis requires just defining a new subclass of
<CODE>Visitor</CODE>&#151;we don't have to touch any of the glyph classes.
We support all future analyses by adding this one operation
to <CODE>Glyph</CODE> and its subclasses.</P>

<A NAME="discretionaryglyph"></A>
<P>We've already seen how spelling checking works.  We use a similar
approach in <CODE>HyphenationVisitor</CODE> to accumulate text.  But
once <CODE>HyphenationVisitor</CODE>'s <CODE>VisitCharacter</CODE> operation
has assembled an entire word, it works a little differently.  Instead
of checking the word for misspelling, it applies a hyphenation
algorithm to determine the potential hyphenation points in the word,
if any.  Then at each hyphenation point, it inserts a
<STRONG>discretionary</STRONG> glyph into the composition.  Discretionary
glyphs are instances of <CODE>Discretionary</CODE>, a subclass of
<CODE>Glyph</CODE>.</P>

<A NAME="auto1220"></A>
<P>A discretionary glyph has one of two possible appearances depending on
whether or not it is the last character on a line.  If it's the last
character, then the discretionary looks like a hyphen; if it's not at
the end of a line, then the discretionary has no appearance
whatsoever.  The discretionary checks its parent (a Row object) to see
if it is the last child.  The discretionary makes this check whenever
it's called on to draw itself or calculate its boundaries.  The
formatting strategy treats discretionaries the same as whitespace,
making them candidates for ending a line.  The following diagram shows how
an embedded discretionary can appear.</P>

<A NAME="visitor-patt"></A>
<H3>Visitor Pattern</H3>

<A NAME="auto1221"></A>
<P>What we've described here is an application of the
<A HREF="pat5kfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Visitor (331)</A> pattern.  The Visitor class and its
subclasses described earlier are the key participants in the pattern.
The Visitor pattern captures the technique we've used to allow an
open-ended number of analyses of glyph structures without having to
change the glyph classes themselves.  Another nice feature of visitors
is that they can be applied not just to composites like our glyph
structures but to <EM>any</EM> object structure.  That includes sets,
lists, even directed-acyclic graphs.  Furthermore, the classes that a
visitor can visit needn't be related to each other through a common
parent class.  That means visitors can work across class hierarchies.</P>

<A NAME="auto1222"></A>
<P>An important question to ask yourself before applying the Visitor
pattern is, Which class hierarchies change most often?  The pattern is
most suitable when you want to be able to do a variety of different
things to objects that have a stable class structure.  Adding a new
kind of visitor requires no change to that class structure, which is
especially important when the class structure is large.  But whenever you
add a subclass to the structure, you'll also have to update all your
visitor interfaces to include a <CODE>Visit...</CODE> operation for that
subclass.  In our example that means adding a new
<CODE>Glyph</CODE> subclass called <CODE>Foo</CODE> will require changing
<CODE>Visitor</CODE> and all its subclasses to include a
<CODE>VisitFoo</CODE> operation.  But given our design constraints, we're
much more likely to add a new kind of analysis to Lexi than a new
kind of Glyph.  So the Visitor pattern is well-suited to our needs.</P>

<P>None of these design issues is limited to document editing
applications like Lexi.  Indeed, most nontrivial applications will
have occasion to use many of these patterns, though perhaps to do
different things.  A financial analysis application might use
Composite to define investment portfolios made up of subportfolios and
accounts of different sorts.  A compiler might use the Strategy
pattern to allow different register allocation schemes for different
target machines.  Applications with a graphical user interface will
probably apply at least Decorator and Command just as we have here.</P>

<A NAME="auto1240"></A>
<P>While we've covered several major problems in Lexi's design, there
are lots of others we haven't discussed.  Then again, this book
describes more than just the eight patterns we've used here.  So as
you study the remaining patterns, think about how you might use each
one in Lexi.  Or better yet, think about using them in your own
designs!</P>

<A NAME="footnote1"></A>
<P><SUP>1</SUP>Lexi's design is based on Doc, a text editing
application developed by
Calder [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#calder_doc" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">CL92</A>].</p>
<A NAME="footnote2"></A>
<P><SUP>2</SUP>Authors often view the document in terms of its
<EM>logical</EM> structure as well, that is, in terms of sentences,
paragraphs, sections, subsections, and chapters.  To keep this
example simple, our internal representation won't store information
about the logical structure explicitly. But the design solution we
describe works equally well for representing such information.</p>
<A NAME="footnote3"></A>
<P><SUP>3</SUP>Calder was the first to use the term "glyph" in this
context [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#interviews_glyphs" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">CL90</A>].
Most contemporary document editors don't use an object for every
character, presumably for efficiency reasons.  Calder demonstrated
that this approach is feasible in his thesis [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#calder_thesis" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Cal93</A>].  Our glyphs are less
sophisticated than his in that we have restricted ours to strict
hierarchies for simplicity.  Calder's glyphs can be shared to reduce
storage costs, thereby forming directed-acyclic graph structures.
We can apply the <A HREF="pat4ffs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Flyweight (195)</A>
pattern to get the same effect, but we'll leave that as an exercise
for the reader.</p>
<A NAME="footnote4"></A>
<P><SUP>4</SUP>The interface we describe
here is purposely minimal to keep the discussion simple.  A complete
interface would include operations for managing graphical attributes
such as color, font, and coordinate transformations, plus operations
for more sophisticated child management.</p>
<A NAME="footnote5"></A>
<P><SUP>5</SUP>An integer index is probably not the best way to specify
a glyph's children, depending on the data structure the glyph uses.
If it stores its children in a linked list, then a pointer into the
list would be more efficient. We'll see a better solution to the
indexing problem in <A HREF="#sec2-8-3">Section 2.8</A>, when we discuss document analysis.</p>
<P><SUP>6</SUP><A NAME="footnote6"></A>The user will have even more to say about the
document's <EM>logical</EM> structure&#151;the sentences, paragraphs,
sections, chapters, and so forth. The <EM>physical</EM> structure is less
interesting by comparison. Most people don't care where the linebreaks
in a paragraph occur as long as the paragraph is formatted properly.
The same is true for formatting columns and pages. Thus users end up
specifying only high-level constraints on the physical structure,
leaving Lexi to do the hard work of satisfying them.</p>
<A NAME="footnote7"></A>
<P><SUP>7</SUP>The compositor must get the character codes of
Character glyphs in order to compute the linebreaks.  In <A HREF="#section_encapsulating_the_analysis">Section 2.8</A> we'll see how
to get this information polymorphically without adding a
character-specific operation to the Glyph interface.</p>
<A NAME="footnote8"></A>
<P><SUP>8</SUP>That is, redoing an operation that was just undone.</p>
<A NAME="footnote9"></A>
<P><SUP>9</SUP>Conceptually, the client is Lexi's user, but in
reality it's another object (such as an event dispatcher) that
manages inputs from the user.</P>
<A NAME="footnote10"></A>
<P><SUP>10</SUP>
We could use function overloading to give each of these member
functions the same name, since their parameters already differentiate
them.  We've given them different names here to emphasize their
differences, especially when they're called.</P>
<A NAME="footnote11"></A>
<P><SUP>11</SUP><CODE>IsMisspelled</CODE> implements the spelling
algorithm, which we won't detail here because we've made it
independent of Lexi's design.  We can support different algorithms
by subclassing <CODE>SpellingChecker</CODE>; alternatively, we can
apply the <A HREF="pat5ifs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Strategy (315)</A>
pattern (as we did for formatting in <A HREF="#editor_sec_formatting">Section 2.3</A>) to support
different spelling checking algorithms.</p>

<A NAME="footnote12"></A>
<P><SUP>12</SUP>"Visit" is just a slightly more
general term for "analyze." It foreshadows the terminology we use in
the design pattern we're leading to.</p>
