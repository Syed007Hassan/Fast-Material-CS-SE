<A NAME="auto1002"></A>
<P>Sometimes it's necessary to issue requests to objects without knowing
anything about the operation being requested or the receiver of the
request.  For example, user interface toolkits include objects like
buttons and menus that carry out a request in response to user input.
But the toolkit can't implement the request explicitly in the button
or menu, because only applications that use the toolkit know what
should be done on which object.  As toolkit designers we have no way
of knowing the receiver of the request or the operations that will
carry it out.</P>

<A NAME="toolkit2"></A>
<P>The Command pattern lets toolkit objects make requests of unspecified
application objects by turning the request itself into an object. This
object can be stored and passed around like other objects. The key to
this pattern is an abstract Command class, which declares an interface
for executing operations.  In the simplest form this interface
includes an abstract Execute operation.  Concrete Command subclasses
specify a receiver-action pair by storing the receiver as an instance
variable and by implementing Execute to invoke the request.  The
receiver has the knowledge required to carry out the request.</P>

<A NAME="233c"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/comma081.gif"></P>

<A NAME="document-234"></A>
<P>Menus can be implemented easily with Command objects.  Each choice in
a Menu is an instance of a MenuItem class.  An Application class creates
these menus and their menu items along with the rest of the user interface.
The Application class also keeps track of Document objects that a user has
opened.</P>

<A NAME="auto1003"></A>
<P>The application configures each MenuItem with an instance of a
concrete Command subclass.  When the user selects a MenuItem, the
MenuItem calls Execute on its command, and Execute carries out the
operation.  MenuItems don't know which subclass of Command they use.
Command subclasses store the receiver of the request and invoke one or
more operations on the receiver.</P>

<A NAME="auto1004"></A>
<P>For example, PasteCommand supports pasting text from the clipboard
into a Document.  PasteCommand's receiver is the Document object it is
supplied upon instantiation. The Execute operation invokes Paste on
the receiving Document.</P>

<A NAME="234c"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/comma078.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1005"></A>
<P>OpenCommand's Execute operation is different: it prompts the user
for a document name, creates a corresponding Document object, adds the
document to the receiving application, and opens the document.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/comma079.gif">

<A NAME="macrocommand"></A>
<A NAME="sequence-request"></A>
<P>Sometimes a MenuItem needs to execute a <EM>sequence</EM> of commands.
For example, a MenuItem for centering a page at normal size could be
constructed from a CenterDocumentCommand object and a
NormalSizeCommand object.  Because it's common to string commands
together in this way, we can define a MacroCommand class to allow a
MenuItem to execute an open-ended number of commands.  MacroCommand is
a concrete Command subclass that simply executes a sequence of
Commands.  MacroCommand has no explicit receiver, because the commands
it sequences define their own receiver.</P>

<A NAME="command-eg-macro"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/comma080.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1006"></A>
<P>In each of these examples, notice how the Command pattern decouples
the object that invokes the operation from the one having the
knowledge to perform it.  This gives us a lot of flexibility in
designing our user interface.  An application can provide both a menu
and a push button interface to a feature just by making the menu and
the push button share an instance of the same concrete Command subclass.
We can replace commands dynamically, which would be useful for
implementing context-sensitive menus.  We can also support command
scripting by composing commands into larger ones.  All of this is
possible because the object that issues a request only needs to know
how to issue it; it doesn't need to know how the request will be carried out.</P>

<LI>    parameterize objects by an action to perform, as MenuItem objects
    did above.  You can express such parameterization in a procedural

    address space-independent way, then you can transfer a command
    object for the request to a different process and fulfill the
    request there.</LI>

<A NAME="support-undo"></A>
<LI>    support undo.  The Command's Execute operation can store state for
    reversing its effects in the command itself. The Command interface
    must have an added Unexecute operation that reverses the effects
    of a previous call to Execute.  Executed commands are stored in a
    history list.  Unlimited-level undo and redo is achieved by
    traversing this list backwards and forwards calling Unexecute and
    Execute, respectively.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1012"></A>
<LI>    support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a
    system crash.  By augmenting the Command interface with load and
    store operations, you can keep a persistent log of changes.
    Recovering from a crash involves reloading logged commands from
    disk and reexecuting them with the Execute operation.</LI>

<A NAME="def-transaction"></A>
<LI>    structure a system around high-level operations built on
    primitives operations.  Such a structure is common in information
    systems that support <STRONG>transactions</STRONG>. A transaction
    encapsulates a set of changes to data. The Command pattern offers
    a way to model transactions.  Commands have a common interface,
    letting you invoke all transactions the same way.  The pattern
    also makes it easy to extend the system with new transactions.</LI>

<P>Consider the following issues when implementing the Command pattern:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1051"></A>
<LI><EM>How intelligent should a command be?</EM>
A command can have a wide range of abilities.  At one extreme it
merely defines a binding between a receiver and the actions that carry
out the request.  At the other extreme it implements everything itself
without delegating to a receiver at all.  The latter extreme is useful
when you want to define commands that are independent of existing
classes, when no suitable receiver exists, or when a command knows its
receiver implicitly.  For example, a command that creates another
application window may be just as capable of creating the window as
any other object.  Somewhere in between these extremes are commands
that have enough knowledge to find their receiver dynamically.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1052"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="supp-undo-redo"></A>
<LI><EM>Supporting undo and redo.</EM>
Commands can support undo and redo capabilities if they provide a way
to reverse their execution (e.g., an Unexecute or Undo operation).  A
ConcreteCommand class might need to store additional state to do so.  This
state can include</LI>

<A NAME="auto1053"></A>
<P></P>

<UL>

<A NAME="receive-part-command2"></A>
<LI>the Receiver object, which actually carries out operations in
response to the request,</LI>

<A NAME="auto1054"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1055"></A>
<LI>the arguments to the operation performed on the receiver, and</LI>

<A NAME="auto1056"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1057"></A>
<LI>any original values in the receiver that can change
as a result of handling the request.  The receiver must provide
operations that let the command return the receiver to its prior state.</LI>

</UL>

<A NAME="auto1058"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1059"></A>
<P>To support one level of undo, an application needs to store only the
command that was executed last.  For multiple-level undo and redo, the
application needs a <STRONG>history list</STRONG> of commands that have
been executed, where the maximum length of the list determines the
number of undo/redo levels.  The history list stores sequences of
commands that have been executed.  Traversing backward through the
list and reverse-executing commands cancels their effect; traversing
forward and executing commands reexecutes them.</P>

<A NAME="auto1060"></A>
<P>An undoable command might have to be copied before it can be placed on
the history list.  That's because the command object that carried out
the original request, say, from a MenuItem, will perform other
requests at later times.  Copying is required to distinguish different
invocations of the same command if its state can vary across
invocations.</P>

<A NAME="proto-w-command"></A>
<P>For example, a DeleteCommand that deletes selected objects must store
different sets of objects each time it's executed.  Therefore the
DeleteCommand object must be copied following execution, and the copy
is placed on the history list.  If the command's state never changes
on execution, then copying is not required&#151;only a reference to the
command need be placed on the history list.  Commands that must be
copied before being placed on the history list act as prototypes (see
<A HREF="pat3dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Prototype (117)</A>).</P>

<A NAME="avoid-error"></A>
<LI><EM>Avoiding error accumulation in the undo process.</EM>
Hysteresis can be a problem in ensuring a reliable,
semantics-preserving undo/redo mechanism.  Errors can accumulate as
commands are executed, unexecuted, and reexecuted repeatedly so that
an application's state eventually diverges from original values.  It
may be necessary therefore to store more information in the command to
ensure that objects are restored to their original state.  The
<A HREF="pat5ffs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Memento (283)</A> pattern can be applied to give the command
access to this information without exposing the internals of other
objects.</LI>

<P></P>

<A NAME="template-implement"></A>
<LI><EM>Using C++ templates.</EM>
For commands that (1) aren't undoable and (2) don't require arguments,
we can use C++ templates to avoid creating a Command subclass for

<A NAME="unidraw-use-comm"></A>
<P>Perhaps the first example of the Command pattern appears in a paper by
Lieberman [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#lieberman_menus" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Lie85</A>].  MacApp [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#macapp" TARGET=

"_mainDisplayFrame">App89</A>] popularized
the notion of commands for implementing undoable operations.
ET++ [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#et++" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">WGM88</A>], InterViews [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#InterViews3.1" TARGET="_main

DisplayFrame">LCI+92</A>], and
Unidraw [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#unidraw_framework" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">VL90</A>] also define classes that follow the
Command pattern. InterViews defines an Action abstract class that
provides command functionality. It also defines an ActionCallback
template, parameterized by action method, that can instantiate command
subclasses automatically.</P>

<A NAME="think-use-comm"></A>
<P>The THINK class library [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#think" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Sym93b</A>] also uses commands to support

interpretation, and the result of the interpration varies with the
receiving object.  Moreover, the receiver may delegate the
interpretation to another object, typically the receiver's parent in a
larger structure as in a Chain of Responsibility.  The receiver of a
Unidraw command is thus computed rather than stored.  Unidraw's
interpretation mechanism depends on run-time type information.</P>

<P>Coplien describes how to implement <STRONG>functors</STRONG>, objects that
are functions, in C++ [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#coplien_idioms" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Cop92</A>].  He achieves a degree of
transparency in their use by overloading the function call operator
(<CODE>operator()</CODE>).  The Command pattern is different; its focus
is on maintaining a <EM>binding between</EM> a receiver and a function
(i.e., action), not just maintaining a function.</P>
