<A NAME="auto1001"></A>
<P>Structuring a system into subsystems helps reduce complexity.  A
common design goal is to minimize the communication and dependencies
between subsystems.  One way to achieve this goal is to introduce a
<STRONG>facade</STRONG> object that provides a single, simplified interface
to the more general facilities of a subsystem.</P>

<A NAME="auto1002"></A>
<P>Consider for example a programming environment that gives applications
access to its compiler subsystem.  This subsystem contains classes
such as Scanner, Parser, ProgramNode, BytecodeStream, and
ProgramNodeBuilder that implement the compiler.  Some specialized
applications might need to access these classes directly.  But most
clients of a compiler generally don't care about details like parsing
and code generation; they merely want to compile some code.  For them,
the powerful but low-level interfaces in the compiler subsystem only
complicate their task.</P>

<A NAME="auto1003"></A>
<P>To provide a higher-level interface that can shield clients from these
classes, the compiler subsystem also includes a Compiler class.  This
class defines a unified interface to the compiler's functionality.
The Compiler class acts as a facade: It offers clients a single,
simple interface to the compiler subsystem.  It glues together the
classes that implement compiler functionality without hiding them
completely.  The compiler facade makes life easier for most
programmers without hiding the lower-level functionality from the few
that need it.</P>

<A NAME="auto1005"></A>
<LI>you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
Subsystems often get more complex as they evolve.  Most patterns, when
applied, result in more and smaller classes.  This makes the subsystem
more reusable and easier to customize, but it also becomes harder to
use for clients that don't need to customize it.  A facade can provide
a simple default view of the subsystem that is good enough for most
clients.  Only clients needing more customizability will need to look
beyond the facade.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1027"></A>
<LI>It shields clients from subsystem components, thereby reducing the number

<P></P>
<A NAME="auto1029"></A>
<LI>It promotes weak coupling between the subsystem and its clients.
Often the components in a subsystem are strongly coupled.  Weak
coupling lets you vary the components of the subsystem without
affecting its clients.  Facades help layer a system and the
dependencies between objects.  They can eliminate complex or
circular dependencies.  This can be an important consequence when
the client and the subsystem are implemented independently.

<A NAME="auto1030"></A>
<P>Reducing compilation dependencies is vital in large software
systems.  You want to save time by minimizing recompilation when
subsystem classes change.  Reducing compilation dependencies with
facades can limit the recompilation needed for a small change in
an important subsystem.  A facade can also simplify porting
systems to other platforms, because it's less likely that building
one subsystem requires building all others.</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1034"></A>
<LI><EM>Reducing client-subsystem coupling.</EM>
The coupling between clients and the subsystem can be reduced even
further by making Facade an abstract class with concrete subclasses
for different implementations of a subsystem.  Then clients can
communicate with the subsystem through the interface of the abstract
Facade class. This abstract coupling keeps clients from knowing which
implementation of a subsystem is used.

<A NAME="auto1035"></A>
<P>An alternative to subclassing is to configure a Facade object with
different subsystem objects.  To customize the facade, simply replace
one or more of its subsystem objects.

</LI>
<A NAME="auto1036"></A>
<P></P>
<A NAME="auto1037"></A>
<LI><EM>Public versus private subsystem classes.</EM>
A subsystem is analogous to a class in that both have interfaces, and
both encapsulate something&#151;a class encapsulates state and
operations, while a subsystem encapsulates classes.  And just as it's
useful to think of the public and private interface of a class, we can
think of the public and private interface of a subsystem.

<A NAME="auto1038"></A>
<P>The public interface to a subsystem consists of classes that all
clients can access; the private interface is just for subsystem
extenders.  The Facade class is part of the public interface, of
course, but it's not the only part.  Other subsystem classes are
usually public as well.  For example, the classes Parser and Scanner
in the compiler subsystem are part of the public interface.</P>

<A NAME="auto1039"></A>
<P>Making subsystem classes private would be useful, but few
object-oriented languages support it.  Both C++ and Smalltalk
traditionally have had a global name space for classes.  Recently,
however, the C++ standardization committee added name spaces to the
language [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#c++_namespaces" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Str94</A>], which will let you expose just the
public subsystem classes.</P>

<P>Let's take a closer look at how to put a facade on a compiler
subsystem.</P>

<A NAME="auto1041"></A>
<P>The compiler subsystem defines a {BytecodeStream} class that
implements a stream of <CODE>Bytecode</CODE> objects.  A
<CODE>Bytecode</CODE> object encapsulates a bytecode, which can specify machine
instructions.  The subsystem also defines a <CODE>Token</CODE> class for
objects that encapsulate tokens in the programming language.</P>

<A NAME="auto1042"></A>
<P>The <CODE>Scanner</CODE> class takes a stream of characters and produces
a stream of tokens, one token at a time.</P>

<A NAME="auto1046"></A>

the parse tree incrementally.  These classes interact according to the

<A NAME="auto1048"></A>
<P>The parse tree is made up of instances of <CODE>ProgramNode</CODE>
subclasses such as <CODE>StatementNode</CODE>,
<CODE>ExpressionNode</CODE>, and so forth.  The <CODE>ProgramNode</CODE>
hierarchy is an example of the <A HREF="pat4cfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Composite (163)</A>
pattern. <CODE>ProgramNode</CODE> defines an interface for manipulating
the program node and its children, if any.</P>

object.  <CODE>ProgramNode</CODE> subclasses use this object to generate

<P><CODE>CodeGenerator</CODE> has subclasses, for example,
<CODE>StackMachineCodeGenerator</CODE> and <CODE>RISCCodeGenerator</CODE>,
that generate machine code for different hardware architectures.</P>

<A NAME="auto1052"></A>
<P>Each subclass of <CODE>ProgramNode</CODE> implements <CODE>Traverse</CODE>
to call <CODE>Traverse</CODE> on its child <CODE>ProgramNode</CODE>
objects.  In turn, each child does the same for its children, and so
on recursively.  For example, <CODE>ExpressionNode</CODE> defines
<CODE>Traverse</CODE> as follows:</P>

<A NAME="auto1053"></A>
<PRE>
    void ExpressionNode::Traverse (CodeGenerator&amp; cg) {
        cg.Visit(this);
    
        ListIterator<ProgramNode*> i(_children);
    
        for (i.First(); !i.IsDone(); i.Next()) {
            i.CurrentItem()->Traverse(cg);
        }
    }

<A NAME="auto1054"></A>
<P>The classes we've discussed so far make up the compiler subsystem.
Now we'll introduce a <CODE>Compiler</CODE> class, a facade that puts all
these pieces together.  <CODE>Compiler</CODE> provides a simple interface
for compiling source and generating code for a particular machine.</P>

<A NAME="auto1055"></A>
<PRE>
    class Compiler {
    public:

        virtual void Compile(istream&amp;, BytecodeStream&amp;);
    };
    
    void Compiler::Compile (
        istream&amp; input, BytecodeStream&amp; output
    ) {
        Scanner scanner(input);
        ProgramNodeBuilder builder;

        parseTree->Traverse(generator);

</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1056"></A>
<P>This implementation hard-codes the type of code generator to use so
that programmers aren't required to specify the target architecture.
That might be reasonable if there's only ever one target architecture.
If that's not the case, then we might want to change the
<CODE>Compiler</CODE> constructor to take a <CODE>CodeGenerator</CODE>
parameter.  Then programmers can specify the generator to use when
they instantiate <CODE>Compiler</CODE>.  The compiler facade can
parameterize other participants such as <CODE>Scanner</CODE> and
<CODE>ProgramNodeBuilder</CODE> as well, which adds flexibility, but it also
detracts from the Facade pattern's mission, which is to simplify the
interface for the common case.</P>

<A NAME="et-use-facade"></A>
<P>In the ET++ application framework [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#et++" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">WGM88</A>], an application can have
built-in browsing tools for inspecting its objects at run-time.  These
browsing tools are implemented in a separate subsystem that includes a
Facade class called "ProgrammingEnvironment."  This facade defines
operations such as InspectObject and InspectClass for accessing the
browsers.</P>

<A NAME="auto1058"></A>
<P>An ET++ application can also forgo built-in browsing support.  In
that case, ProgrammingEnvironment implements these requests as null
operations; that is, they do nothing.  Only the
ETProgrammingEnvironment subclass implements these requests with
operations that display the corresponding browsers.  The application
has no knowledge of whether a browsing environment is available or
not; there's abstract coupling between the application and the
browsing subsystem.</P>

processes, storage, and address spaces.  For each of these
abstractions there is a corresponding subsystem, implemented as a
framework, that supports porting Choices to a variety of different
hardware platforms.  Two of these subsystems have a "representative"
(i.e., facade). These representatives are FileSystemInterface (storage)
and Domain (address spaces).</P>

<P>For example, the virtual memory framework has Domain as its facade.  A
Domain represents an address space.  It provides a mapping between
virtual addresses and offsets into memory objects, files, or backing
store.  The main operations on Domain support adding a memory object
at a particular address, removing a memory object, and handling a page
fault.</P>

occurs.  The Domain finds the memory object at the address causing the
fault and delegates the RepairFault operation to the cache associated
with that memory object.  Domains can be customized by changing their

colleagues are aware of and communicate with the mediator instead
