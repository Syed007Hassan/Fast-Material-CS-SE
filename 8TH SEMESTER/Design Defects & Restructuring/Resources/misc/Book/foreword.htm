<P>Consider the work of a future software archeologist, tracing
the history of computing. The fossil record will likely show clear
strata: here is a layer formed of assembly language artifacts,
there is a layer populated with the skeletons of high order
programming languages (with certain calcified legacy parts
probably still showing some signs of life). Each such layer will
be intersected with the imprint of other factors that have shaped
the software landscape: components, residue from the great
operating system and browser wars, methods, processes, tools. Each
line in this strata marks a definitive event: below that line,
computing was this way; above that line, the art of computing had
changed.</P>
<A NAME="foreword2"></A>
<P><CITE>Design Patterns</CITE> draws such a line of demarcation;
this is a work that represents a change in the practice of
computing. Erich, Richard, Ralph, and John present a compelling
case for the importance of patterns in crafting complex systems.
Additionally, they give us a language of common patterns that can
be used in a variety of domains.</P>
<A NAME="foreword3"></A>
<P>The impact of this work cannot be overstated. As I travel about
the world working with projects of varying domains and
complexities, it is uncommon for me to encounter developers who
have not at least heard of the patterns movement.  In the more
successful projects, it is quite common to see many of these
design patterns actually used.</P>
<A NAME="foreword4"></A>
<P>With this book, the Gang of Four have made a seminal
contribution to software engineering. There is much to learned
from them, and much to be actively applied.</P>
