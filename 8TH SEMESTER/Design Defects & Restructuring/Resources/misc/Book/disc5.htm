<H2><A HREF="#objects"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: Objects as 
Arguments"></A> Encapsulating Variation</H2>
<A NAME="disc5-2"></A>
<P>Encapsulating variation is a theme of many behavioral patterns.  When
an aspect of a program changes frequently, these patterns define an
object that encapsulates that aspect.  Then other parts of the program
can collaborate with the object whenever they depend on that aspect.
The patterns usually define an abstract class that describes the
encapsulating object, and the pattern derives its name from that
object.<A NAME="fn12"></A><A HREF="#footnote12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
For example,</P>

<UL>
<A NAME="disc5-3"></A>
<LI>a Strategy object encapsulates an algorithm (<A HREF="pat5ifs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Strategy (315)</A>),</LI>

<P></P>
<A NAME="disc5-4"></A>
<LI>a State object encapsulates a state-dependent behavior
(<A HREF="pat5hfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">State (305)</A>),</LI>

<P></P>
<A NAME="disc5-5"></A>
<LI>a Mediator object encapsulates the protocol between
objects (<A HREF="pat5efs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Mediator (273)</A>), and</LI>

<P></P>
<A NAME="disc5-6"></A>
<LI>an Iterator object encapsulates the way you access and traverse the
components of an aggregate object (<A HREF="pat5dfs.htm"
TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Iterator (257)</A>).</LI>

</UL>
<A NAME="disc5-7"></A>
<P>These patterns describe aspects of a program that are likely to
change. Most patterns have two kinds of objects: the new object(s)
that encapsulate the aspect, and the existing object(s) that use the
new ones. Usually the functionality of new objects would be an
integral part of the existing objects were it not for the pattern. For
example, code for a Strategy would probably be wired into the
strategy's Context, and code for a State would be implemented directly
in the state's Context.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-8"></A>
<P>But not all object behavioral patterns partition functionality like
this.  For example, <A HREF="pat5afs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Chain of Responsibility (223)</A> deals
with an arbitrary number of objects (i.e., a chain), all of which may
already exist in the system.  </P>
<A NAME="disc5-9"></A>
<P>Chain of Responsibility illustrates another difference in behavioral
patterns: Not all define static communication relationships between
classes.  Chain of Responsibility prescribes communication between an
open-ended number of objects.  Other patterns involve objects that are
passed around as arguments.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-10"></A>
<A NAME="objects"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#media-vs-obsrv"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: Should 
Communication be Encapsulated or Distributed?"></A> Objects as Arguments</H2>
<A NAME="disc5-11"></A>
<P>Several patterns introduce an object that's <EM>always</EM> used
as an argument.  One of these is
<A HREF="pat5kfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Visitor (331)</A>.
A Visitor object is the
argument to a polymorphic Accept operation on the objects it visits.
The visitor is never considered a part of those objects, even though
the conventional alternative to the pattern is to distribute Visitor
code across the object structure classes.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-12"></A>
<A NAME="magictoken"></A>
<P>Other patterns define objects that act as magic tokens to be passed
around and invoked at a later time. Both
<A HREF="pat5bfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Command (233)</A>
and
<A HREF="pat5ffs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Memento (283)</A>
fall into this category. In Command,
the token represents a request; in Memento, it represents the internal
state of an object at a particular time.
In both cases, the token can have a complex internal representation,
but the client is never aware of it.  But even here there are
differences.  Polymorphism is important in the Command pattern,
because executing the Command object is a polymorphic operation.  In
contrast, the Memento interface is so narrow that a memento can only
be passed as a value.  So it's likely to present no polymorphic
operations at all to its clients.</P>

<H2><A HREF="#decouple-sandr"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: Decoupling 
Senders and Receivers"></A> Should Communication be Encapsulated or Distributed?</H2>
<A NAME="disc5-14"></A>
<P><A HREF="pat5efs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Mediator (273)</A>
and
<A HREF="pat5gfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Observer (293)</A> are
competing patterns. The difference between them is that Observer
distributes communication by introducing Observer and Subject objects,
whereas a Mediator object encapsulates the communication between other
objects.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-15"></A>
<P>In the Observer pattern, there is no single object that encapsulates a
constraint. Instead, the Observer and the Subject must cooperate to
maintain the constraint. Communication patterns are determined by the
way observers and subjects are interconnected: a single subject
usually has many observers, and sometimes the observer of one subject
is a subject of another observer.  The Mediator pattern centralizes
rather than distributes.  It places the responsibility for maintaining
a constraint squarely in the mediator.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-16"></A>
<P>We've found it easier to make reusable Observers and Subjects than to
make reusable Mediators. The Observer pattern promotes partitioning
and loose coupling between Observer and Subject, and that leads to
finer-grained classes that are more apt to be reused. </P>
<A NAME="disc5-17"></A>
<P>On the other hand, it's easier to understand the flow of communication
in Mediator than in Observer.  Observers and subjects are usually
connected shortly after they're created, and it's hard to see how they
are connected later in the program.  If you know the Observer pattern,
then you understand that the way observers and subjects are connected
is important, and you also know what connections to look for.
However, the indirection that Observer introduces will still make a
system harder to understand.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-18"></A>
<P>Observers in Smalltalk can be parameterized with messages to access
the Subject state, and so they are even more reusable than they are in
C++.  This makes Observer more attractive than Mediator in Smalltalk.
Thus a Smalltalk programmer will often use Observer where a C++
programmer would use Mediator.</P>

Decoupling Senders and Receivers</H2>
<A NAME="disc5-20"></A>
<P>When collaborating objects refer to each other directly, they become
dependent on each other, and that can have an adverse impact on the
layering and reusability of a system.  Command, Observer, Mediator,
and Chain of Responsibility address how you can decouple senders and
receivers, but with different trade-offs.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-21"></A>
<P>The Command pattern supports decoupling by using a Command object to
define the binding between a sender and receiver:</P>
<A NAME="disc5-22"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/cmddec.gif"></P>
<A NAME="disc5-23"></A>
<P>The Command object provides a simple interface for issuing the request
(that is, the Execute operation).  Defining the sender-receiver
connection in a separate object lets the sender work with different
receivers.  It keeps the sender decoupled from the receivers, making
senders easy to reuse.  Moreover, you can reuse the Command object to
parameterize a receiver with different senders.  The Command pattern
nominally requires a subclass for each sender-receiver connection,
although the pattern describes implementation techniques that avoid
subclassing.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-24"></A>
<A NAME="media-vs-obsrv2"></A>
<P>The Observer pattern decouples senders (subjects) from receivers
(observers) by defining an interface for signaling changes in
subjects.  Observer defines a looser sender-receiver binding than
Command, since a subject may have multiple observers, and their number
can vary at run-time.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-25"></A>
<A NAME="subj-347i"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/obser024.gif"></P>
<A NAME="disc5-26"></A>
<P>The Subject and Observer interfaces in the Observer pattern are
designed for communicating changes.  Therefore the Observer pattern is
best for decoupling objects when there are data dependencies between
them.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-27"></A>
<P>The Mediator pattern decouples objects by having them refer to each
other indirectly through a Mediator object.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-28"></A>
<A NAME="media-348i"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/media035.gif"></P>
<A NAME="disc5-29"></A>
<P>A Mediator object routes requests between Colleague objects and
centralizes their communication.  Consequently, colleagues can only
talk to each other through the Mediator interface.  Because this
interface is fixed, the Mediator might have to implement its own
dispatching scheme for added flexibility. Requests can be encoded and
arguments packed in such a way that colleagues can request an
open-ended set of operations.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-30"></A>
<P>The Mediator pattern can reduce subclassing in a system, because it
centralizes communication behavior in one class instead of
distributing it among subclasses. However, <EM>ad hoc</EM> dispatching schemes
often decrease type safety.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-31"></A>
<P>Finally, the Chain of Responsibility pattern decouples the sender from
the receiver by passing the request along a chain of potential
receivers:</P>
<A NAME="disc5-32"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/chain093.gif"></P>
<A NAME="disc5-33"></A>
<A NAME="media-vs-cor"></A>
<P>Since the interface between senders and receivers is fixed, Chain of
Responsibility may also require a custom dispatching scheme.  Hence it
has the same type-safety drawbacks as Mediator.  Chain of
Responsibility is a good way to decouple the sender and the receiver
if the chain is already part of the system's structure, and one of
several objects may be in a position to handle the request.  Moreover,
the pattern offers added flexibility in that the chain can be changed or
extended easily.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-34"></A>

<H2><A HREF="#last"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: navigation"></A>
Summary</H2>
<A NAME="disc5-35"></A>
<P>With few exceptions, behavioral design patterns complement and
reinforce each other.  A class in a chain of responsibility, for
example, will probably include at least one application of
<A HREF="pat5jfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Template Method (325)</A>.
The template method can use
primitive operations to determine whether the object should handle the
request and to choose the object to forward to.  The chain can use the
Command pattern to represent requests as objects.
<A HREF="pat5cfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Interpreter (243)</A> can use the State pattern to
define parsing contexts.  An iterator can traverse an aggregate, and a
visitor can apply an operation to each element in the aggregate.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-36"></A>
<P>Behavioral patterns work well with other patterns, too. For example, a
system that uses the <A HREF="pat4cfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Composite (163)</A> pattern might use
a visitor to perform operations on components of the
composition.  It could use Chain of Responsibility to let components
access global properties through their parent.  It could also use
<A HREF="pat4dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Decorator (175)</A>
to override these properties on parts
of the composition.  It could use the Observer pattern to tie one
object structure to another and the State pattern to let a component
change its behavior as its state changes. The composition itself might
be created using the approach in
<A HREF="pat3bfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Builder (97)</A>, and it
might be treated as a
<A HREF="pat3dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Prototype (117)</A> by some other
part of the system.</P>
<A NAME="disc5-37"></A>
<P>Well-designed object-oriented systems are just like this&#151;they have
multiple patterns embedded in them&#151;but not because their designers
necessarily thought in these terms.  Composition at the <EM>pattern</EM>
level rather than the class or object levels lets us achieve the same
synergy with greater ease.</P>
