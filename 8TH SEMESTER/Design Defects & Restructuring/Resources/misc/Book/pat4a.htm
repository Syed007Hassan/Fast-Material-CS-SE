<A NAME="auto1002"></A>
<P>Sometimes a toolkit class that's designed for reuse isn't reusable
only because its interface doesn't match the domain-specific interface
an application requires.</P>

<A NAME="auto1003"></A>
<P>Consider for example a drawing editor that lets users draw and arrange
graphical elements (lines, polygons, text, etc.) into pictures and
diagrams.  The drawing editor's key abstraction is the graphical
object, which has an editable shape and can draw itself.  The
interface for graphical objects is defined by an abstract class called
Shape.  The editor defines a subclass of Shape for each kind of
graphical object: a LineShape class for lines, a PolygonShape class
for polygons, and so forth.</P>

<A NAME="textshape"></A>
<A NAME="textview"></A>
<P>Classes for elementary geometric shapes like LineShape and
PolygonShape are rather easy to implement, because their drawing and
editing capabilities are inherently limited.  But a TextShape subclass
that can display and edit text is considerably more difficult to
implement, since even basic text editing involves complicated screen
update and buffer management.  Meanwhile, an off-the-shelf user
interface toolkit might already provide a sophisticated TextView class
for displaying and editing text.  Ideally we'd like to reuse TextView
to implement TextShape, but the toolkit wasn't designed with Shape
classes in mind.  So we can't use TextView and Shape objects
interchangeably.</P>

<A NAME="auto1004"></A>
<P>How can existing and unrelated classes like TextView work in an
application that expects classes with a different and incompatible
interface?  We could change the TextView class so that it conforms to
the Shape interface, but that isn't an option unless we have the
toolkit's source code.  Even if we did, it wouldn't make sense to
change TextView; the toolkit shouldn't have to adopt domain-specific
interfaces just to make one application work.</P>

<A NAME="adapterdef"></A>
<P>Instead, we could define TextShape so that it <EM>adapts</EM> the
TextView interface to Shape's.  We can do this in one of two ways: (1)
by inheriting Shape's interface and TextView's implementation or (2)
by composing a TextView instance within a TextShape and implementing
TextShape in terms of TextView's interface.  These two approaches
correspond to the class and object versions of the Adapter pattern.
We call TextShape an <STRONG>adapter</STRONG>.</P>

<A NAME="shape-140c"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/adapt105.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1005"></A>
<P>This diagram illustrates the object adapter case. It shows how
BoundingBox requests, declared in class Shape, are converted to
GetExtent requests defined in TextView.  Since TextShape adapts
TextView to the Shape interface, the drawing editor can reuse the
otherwise incompatible TextView class.</P>

<A NAME="auto1006"></A>
<P>Often the adapter is responsible for functionality the adapted class
doesn't provide.  The diagram shows how an adapter can fulfill
such responsibilities.  The user should be able to "drag" every
Shape object to a new location interactively, but TextView isn't
designed to do that.  TextShape can add this missing functionality by
implementing Shape's CreateManipulator operation, which returns an
instance of the appropriate Manipulator subclass.</P>

<A NAME="auto1007"></A>
<P>Manipulator is an abstract class for objects that know how to animate
a Shape in response to user input, like dragging the shape to a new
location.  There are subclasses of Manipulator for different shapes;
TextManipulator, for example, is the corresponding subclass for
TextShape.  By returning a TextManipulator instance, TextShape adds
the functionality that TextView lacks but Shape requires.</P>

Adapters vary in the amount of work they do to adapt Adaptee to
the Target interface.  There is a spectrum of possible work, from
simple interface conversion&#151;for example, changing the names of
operations&#151;to supporting an entirely different set of operations.
The amount of work Adapter does depends on how similar the Target
interface is to Adaptee's.</LI>

<LI><EM>Pluggable adapters.</EM>
A class is more reusable when you minimize the assumptions other
classes must make to use it.  By building interface adaptation into a
class, you eliminate the assumption that other classes see the same
interface.  Put another way, interface adaptation lets us incorporate
our class into existing systems that might expect different interfaces
to the class.
ObjectWorks\Smalltalk [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#parcplace_smalltalk" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Par90</A>] uses the term
<STRONG>pluggable adapter</STRONG> to describe classes with built-in
interface adaptation.

<A NAME="treedisplay"></A>
<P>Consider a TreeDisplay widget that can display tree structures
graphically.  If this were a special-purpose widget for use in just one
application, then we might require the objects that it displays to
have a specific interface; that is, all must descend from a Tree
abstract class.  But if we wanted to make TreeDisplay more reusable
(say we wanted to make it part of a toolkit of useful widgets), then
that requirement would be unreasonable.  Applications will define
their own classes for tree structures.  They shouldn't be forced to
use our Tree abstract class.  Different tree structures will have
different interfaces.</P>

<A NAME="auto1040"></A>
<P>In a directory hierarchy, for example, children might be accessed with
a GetSubdirectories operation, whereas in an inheritance hierarchy,
the corresponding operation might be called GetSubclasses.  A reusable
TreeDisplay widget must be able to display both kinds of hierarchies
even if they use different interfaces.  In other words, the
TreeDisplay should have interface adaptation built into it.</P>

<LI><EM>Using two-way adapters to provide transparency.</EM>
A potential problem with adapters is that they aren't transparent to
all clients.  An adapted object no longer conforms to the Adaptee
interface, so it can't be used as is wherever an Adaptee object can.
<STRONG>Two-way adapters</STRONG> can provide such transparency.
Specifically, they're useful when two different clients need to view
an object differently.

<P>Consider the two-way adapter that integrates Unidraw, a graphical

constraint-solving toolkit [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#qoca" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">HHMV92</A>].  Both systems have classes
that represent variables explicitly: Unidraw has StateVariable, and
QOCA has ConstraintVariable.  To make Unidraw work with QOCA,
ConstraintVariable must be adapted to StateVariable; to let QOCA
propagate solutions to Unidraw, StateVariable must be adapted to
ConstraintVariable.</P>

<A NAME="143c"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/adapt107.gif"></P>

<P>The solution involves a two-way class adapter ConstraintStateVariable,
a subclass of both StateVariable and ConstraintVariable, that adapts
the two interfaces to each other.  Multiple inheritance is a viable
solution in this case because the interfaces of the adapted classes
are substantially different. The two-way class adapter conforms to
both of the adapted classes and can work in either system.</P>

<P>Although the implementation of Adapter is usually straightforward,
here are some issues to keep in mind:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1045"></A>
<LI><EM>Implementing class adapters in C++.</EM>
In a C++ implementation of a class adapter, Adapter
would inherit publicly from Target and privately from Adaptee.
Thus Adapter would be a subtype of Target but not of Adaptee.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1046"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="plugap-imp"></A>
<LI><EM>Pluggable adapters.</EM>
Let's look at three ways to implement pluggable adapters for the
TreeDisplay widget described earlier, which can lay out and display a
hierarchical structure automatically.

<A NAME="auto1047"></A>
<P>The first step, which is common to all three of the implementations
discussed here, is to find a "narrow" interface for Adaptee, that
is, the smallest subset of operations that lets us do the adaptation.
A narrow interface consisting of only a couple of operations is easier
to adapt than an interface with dozens of operations.  For
TreeDisplay, the adaptee is any hierarchical structure.  A minimalist
interface might include two operations, one that defines how to
present a node in the hierarchical structure graphically, and another
that retrieves the node's children.</P>

<A NAME="auto1048"></A>
<P>The narrow interface leads to three implementation approaches:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="absops"></A>
<LI TYPE=a><EM>Using abstract operations.</EM>
Define corresponding abstract operations for the narrow Adaptee
interface in the TreeDisplay class.  Subclasses must implement the
abstract operations and adapt the hierarchically structured object.
For example, a DirectoryTreeDisplay subclass will implement these
operations by accessing the directory structure.

<A NAME="adapter-param1"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/adapt103.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1049"></A>
<P>DirectoryTreeDisplay specializes the narrow interface so that it can
display directory structures made up of FileSystemEntity objects.</P>

</LI>

<A NAME="auto1050"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="use-dele"></A>
<LI TYPE=a><EM>Using delegate objects.</EM>
In this approach, TreeDisplay forwards requests for accessing the hierarchical
structure to a <STRONG>delegate</STRONG> object.  TreeDisplay can use a
different adaptation strategy by substituting a different delegate.

<A NAME="direc-browse"></A>
<P>For example, suppose there exists a DirectoryBrowser that uses a
TreeDisplay.  DirectoryBrowser might make a good delegate for
adapting TreeDisplay to the hierarchical directory structure.  In
dynamically typed languages like Smalltalk or Objective C, this
approach only requires an interface for registering the delegate with
the adapter.  Then TreeDisplay simply forwards the requests to the
delegate.  NEXTSTEP [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#NeXT_AppKit" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Add94</A>] uses this approach heavily to
reduce subclassing.</P>

<A NAME="treeaccdeleg"></A>
<P>Statically typed languages like C++ require an explicit interface
definition for the delegate.  We can specify such an interface by
putting the narrow interface that TreeDisplay requires into an
abstract TreeAccessorDelegate class.  Then we can mix this interface
into the delegate of our choice&#151;DirectoryBrowser in this
case&#151;using inheritance.  We use single inheritance if the
DirectoryBrowser has no existing parent class, multiple inheritance if
it does.  Mixing classes together like this is easier than introducing
a new TreeDisplay subclass and implementing its operations
individually.</P>

<A NAME="adapter-param2"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/adapt102.gif"></P>

</LI>

<A NAME="auto1051"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="parameterized"></A>
<LI TYPE=a><EM>Parameterized adapters.</EM>
The usual way to support pluggable adapters in Smalltalk is to
parameterize an adapter with one or more blocks.  The block construct
supports adaptation without subclassing.  A block can adapt a request,
and the adapter can store a block for each individual request.  In our
example, this means TreeDisplay stores one block for converting a node
into a GraphicNode and another block for accessing a node's children.

<A NAME="auto1052"></A>
<P>For example, to create TreeDisplay on a directory hierarchy, we write</P>

<A NAME="auto1053"></A>
<PRE>
    directoryDisplay :=
        (TreeDisplay on: treeRoot)
             getChildrenBlock:

             createGraphicNodeBlock:
                 [:node | node createGraphicNode].

<P>InterViews 2.6 defines an Interactor abstract class for user
interface elements such as scroll bars, buttons, and menus [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#interviews_graphic" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">VL88</A>].  It also defines a
Graphic abstract class for structured graphic objects such as lines,
circles, polygons, and splines.  Both Interactors and Graphics have
graphical appearances, but they have different interfaces and
implementations (they share no common parent class) and are therefore
incompatible&#151;you can't embed a structured graphic object in,
say, a dialog box directly.</P>

<A NAME="auto1072"></A>
<P>Instead, InterViews 2.6 defines an object adapter called
GraphicBlock, a subclass of Interactor that contains a Graphic
instance.  The GraphicBlock adapts the interface of the Graphic
class to that of Interactor.  The GraphicBlock lets a Graphic
instance be displayed, scrolled, and zoomed within an Interactor
structure.</P>

<P>Pluggable adapters are common in
ObjectWorks\Smalltalk [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#parcplace_smalltalk" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Par90</A>].  Standard Smalltalk defines
a ValueModel class for views that display a single value.  ValueModel
defines a <CODE>value</CODE>, <CODE>value:</CODE> interface for accessing
the value. These are abstract methods.  Application writers access the
value with more domain-specific names like <CODE>width</CODE> and
<CODE>width:</CODE>, but they shouldn't have to subclass ValueModel
to adapt such application-specific names to the ValueModel interface.</P>

<A NAME="auto1073"></A>
<P>Instead, ObjectWorks\Smalltalk includes a subclass of ValueModel
called PluggableAdaptor.  A PluggableAdaptor object adapts other
objects to the ValueModel interface (<CODE>value</CODE>,
<CODE>value:</CODE>).  It can be parameterized with blocks for getting
and setting the desired value.  PluggableAdaptor uses these blocks
internally to implement the
<CODE>value</CODE>, <CODE>value:</CODE> interface.  PluggableAdaptor also
lets you pass in the selector names (e.g., <CODE>width</CODE>,
<CODE>width:</CODE>) directly for syntactic convenience.
It converts these selectors into the corresponding blocks
automatically.</P>

<P>Another example from ObjectWorks\Smalltalk is the TableAdaptor
class.  A TableAdaptor can adapt a sequence of objects to a tabular
presentation.  The table displays one object per row. The client
parameterizes TableAdaptor with the set of messages that a table can
use to get the column values from an object.</P>

<P>Some classes in NeXT's AppKit [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#NeXT_AppKit" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Add94</A>] use delegate objects
to perform interface adaptation.  An example is the NXBrowser class that
can display hierarchical lists of data.  NXBrowser uses a delegate
object for accessing and adapting the data.</P>

<P>Meyer's "Marriage of Convenience" [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#meyer_book-88" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Mey88</A>] is a form of
class adapter.  Meyer describes how a FixedStack class adapts the
implementation of an Array class to the interface of a Stack class.
The result is a stack containing a fixed number of entries.</P>

<P><A HREF="pat4bfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Bridge (151)</A> has
a structure similar to an object adapter, but Bridge has a different
intent: It is meant to separate an interface from its implementation
so that they can be varied easily and independently.  An adapter
is meant to change the interface of an <EM>existing</EM> object.</P>

<A NAME="auto1077"></A>
<P><A HREF="pat4dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Decorator (175)</A>
enhances another object without changing its interface.  A decorator
is thus more transparent to the application than an adapter is. As
a consequence, Decorator supports recursive composition, which
isn't possible with pure adapters.</P>
