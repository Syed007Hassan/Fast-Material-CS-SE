<A NAME="auto1002"></A>
<P>Sometimes it's necessary to record the internal state of an object.
This is required when implementing checkpoints and undo mechanisms
that let users back out of tentative operations or recover from
errors.  You must save state information somewhere so that you can
restore objects to their previous states.  But objects normally
encapsulate some or all of their state, making it inaccessible to
other objects and impossible to save externally.  Exposing this state
would violate encapsulation, which can compromise the application's
reliability and extensibility.</P>

<A NAME="auto1003"></A>
<P>Consider for example a graphical editor that supports connectivity
between objects. A user can connect two rectangles with a line, and
the rectangles stay connected when the user moves either of them.  The
editor ensures that the line stretches to maintain the connection.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/memen029.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1004"></A>
<P>A well-known way to maintain connectivity relationships between
objects is with a constraint-solving system.  We can encapsulate this
functionality in a <STRONG>ConstraintSolver</STRONG> object.
ConstraintSolver records connections as they are made and generates
mathematical equations that describe them.  It solves these equations
whenever the user makes a connection or otherwise modifies the
diagram.  ConstraintSolver uses the results of its calculations to
rearrange the graphics so that they maintain the proper connections.</P>

<A NAME="supp-undo"></A>
<P>Supporting undo in this application isn't as easy as it may seem.  An
obvious way to undo a move operation is to store the original distance
moved and move the object back an equivalent distance.  However, this
does not guarantee all objects will appear where they did before.
Suppose there is some slack in the connection.  In that case, simply
moving the rectangle back to its original location won't necessarily
achieve the desired effect.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/memen028.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1005"></A>
<P>In general, the ConstraintSolver's public interface might be
insufficient to allow precise reversal of its effects on other
objects. The undo mechanism must work more closely with
ConstraintSolver to reestablish previous state, but we should also
avoid exposing the ConstraintSolver's internals to the undo mechanism.</P>

<A NAME="orig-def"></A>
<P>We can solve this problem with the Memento pattern. A
<STRONG>memento</STRONG> is an object that stores a snapshot of the
internal state of another object&#151;the memento's
<STRONG>originator</STRONG>. The undo mechanism will request a memento
from the originator when it needs to checkpoint the originator's
state. The originator initializes the memento with information that
characterizes its current state.  Only the originator can store and
retrieve information from the memento&#151;the memento is "opaque" to
other objects.</P>

<A NAME="auto1006"></A>
<P>In the graphical editor example just discussed, the ConstraintSolver can act
as an originator.  The following sequence of events characterizes the
undo process:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1007"></A>

<A NAME="solverstate"></A>
<LI>The ConstraintSolver creates and returns a memento, an instance of a

internal equations and variables.</LI>

<P>The Memento pattern has several consequences:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="presrvencap"></A>
<LI><EM>Preserving encapsulation boundaries.</EM>
Memento avoids exposing information that only an originator should
manage but that must be stored nevertheless outside the originator.
The pattern shields other objects from potentially complex Originator
internals, thereby preserving encapsulation boundaries.</LI>
<A NAME="auto1040"></A>
<P></P>
<A NAME="auto1041"></A>
<LI><EM>It simplifies Originator.</EM>
In other encapsulation-preserving designs, Originator keeps the
versions of internal state that clients have requested.  That puts all
the storage management burden on Originator.  Having clients
manage the state they ask for simplifies Originator and keeps
clients from having to notify originators when they're done.</LI>
<A NAME="auto1042"></A>
<P></P>
<A NAME="auto1043"></A>
<LI><EM>Using mementos might be expensive.</EM>
Mementos might incur considerable overhead if Originator must copy
large amounts of information to store in the memento or if clients
create and return mementos to the originator often enough.  Unless
encapsulating and restoring Originator state is cheap, the pattern
might not be appropriate.  See the discussion of incrementality in the
Implementation section.</LI>
<A NAME="auto1044"></A>
<P></P>
<A NAME="auto1045"></A>
<LI><EM>Defining narrow and wide interfaces.</EM>
It may be difficult in some languages to ensure that only the
originator can access the memento's state.</LI>
<A NAME="auto1046"></A>
<P></P>
<A NAME="auto1047"></A>
<LI><EM>Hidden costs in caring for mementos.</EM>
A caretaker is responsible for deleting the mementos it cares for.
However, the caretaker has no idea how much state is in the memento.
Hence an otherwise lightweight caretaker might incur large storage
costs when it stores mementos.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1048"></A>
<P>Here are two issues to consider when implementing the Memento pattern:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1049"></A>
<LI><EM>Language support.</EM>
Mementos have two interfaces: a wide one for originators and a narrow
one for other objects.  Ideally the implementation language will
support two levels of static protection.  C++ lets you do this by
making the Originator a friend of Memento and making Memento's wide
interface private.  Only the narrow interface should be declared
public.  For example:

<A NAME="auto1050"></A>
<PRE>
    class State;
    
    class Originator {
    public:
        Memento* CreateMemento();
        void SetMemento(const Memento*);
        // ...
    private:
        State* _state;      // internal data structures
        // ...
    };
    
    class Memento {
    public:
        // narrow public interface
        virtual ~Memento();
    private:
        // private members accessible only to Originator
        friend class Originator;
        Memento();
    
        void SetState(State*);
        State* GetState();
        // ...
    private:
        State* _state;
        // ...
    };
</PRE>

</LI>

<A NAME="state-incr-changes"></A>
<LI><EM>Storing incremental changes.</EM>
When mementos get created and passed back to their originator in a
predictable sequence, then Memento can save just the <EM>incremental
change</EM> to the originator's internal state.

<A NAME="undoable"></A>
<P>For example, undoable commands in a history list can use mementos to
ensure that commands are restored to their exact state when they're
undone (see <A HREF="pat5bfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Command (233)</A>).  The history list defines a
specific order in which commands can be undone and redone.  That means
mementos can store just the incremental change that a command makes
rather than the full state of every object they affect.  In the
Motivation example given earlier, the constraint solver can store only those
internal structures that change to keep the line connecting the
rectangles, as opposed to storing the absolute positions of these
objects.</P>

to move a graphical object and <CODE>Unexecute</CODE> to undo the move.
The command stores its target, the distance moved, and an instance of
<CODE>ConstraintSolverMemento</CODE>, a memento containing state from the
constraint solver.</P>

<P>Collections in Dylan [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#Dylan" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">App92</A>] provide an iteration interface that
reflects the Memento pattern. Dylan's collections have the notion of a
"state" object, which is a memento that represents the state of the
iteration. Each collection can represent the current state of the
iteration in any way it chooses; the representation is completely
hidden from clients. The Dylan iteration approach might be translated
to C++ as follows:</P>

<A NAME="auto1060"></A>

    class Collection {

<P><CODE>CreateInitialState</CODE> returns an initialized
<CODE>IterationState</CODE> object for the collection. <CODE>Next</CODE> advances
the state object to the next position in the iteration; it effectively
increments the iteration index.  <CODE>IsDone</CODE> returns
<CODE>true</CODE> if <CODE>Next</CODE> has advanced beyond the last element
in the collection. <CODE>CurrentItem</CODE> dereferences the state
object and returns the element in the collection to which it refers.
<CODE>Copy</CODE> returns a copy of the given state object.  This is
useful for marking a point in an iteration.</P>

<P>The memento-based iteration interface has two interesting benefits:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1065"></A>
<LI>More than one state can work on the same collection.  (The same
is true of the <A HREF="pat5dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Iterator (257)</A> pattern.)</LI>
<A NAME="auto1066"></A>
<P></P>
<A NAME="auto1067"></A>
<LI>It doesn't require breaking a collection's encapsulation
to support iteration.  The memento is only interpreted by the
collection itself; no one else has access to it.  Other approaches to
iteration require breaking encapsulation by making iterator classes
friends of their collection classes (see
<A HREF="pat5dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Iterator (257)</A>). The situation is reversed in the
memento-based implementation: <CODE>Collection</CODE> is a friend of the
<CODE>IteratorState</CODE>.</LI>

</OL>

<A NAME="qoca-use-memento"></A>
<P>The QOCA constraint-solving toolkit stores incremental information in
mementos [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#qoca" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">HHMV92</A>].  Clients can obtain a memento that characterizes
the current solution to a system of constraints.  The memento contains
only those constraint variables that have changed since the last
solution.  Usually only a small subset of the solver's variables
changes for each new solution.  This subset is enough to return the
solver to the preceding solution; reverting to earlier solutions
requires restoring mementos from the intervening solutions.  Hence you
can't set mementos in any order; QOCA relies on a history mechanism to
revert to earlier solutions.</P>
