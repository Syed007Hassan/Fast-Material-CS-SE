<A NAME="auto1002"></A>
<P>Consider a user interface toolkit that supports multiple look-and-feel
standards, such as Motif and Presentation Manager.  Different
look-and-feels define different appearances and behaviors for user
interface "widgets" like scroll bars, windows, and buttons.  To be
portable across look-and-feel standards, an application should not
hard-code its widgets for a particular look and feel.  Instantiating
look-and-feel-specific classes of widgets throughout the application
makes it hard to change the look and feel later.</P>

<A NAME="widgetfactory"></A>
<P>We can solve this problem by defining an abstract WidgetFactory class
that declares an interface for creating each basic kind of widget.

There's also an abstract class for each kind of widget, and concrete
subclasses implement widgets for specific look-and-feel standards.
WidgetFactory's interface has an operation that returns a new widget
object for each abstract widget class.  Clients call these operations
to obtain widget instances, but clients aren't aware of the concrete
classes they're using.  Thus clients stay independent of the
prevailing look and feel.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/abfac109.gif">


<A NAME="auto1003"></A>
<P>There is a concrete subclass of WidgetFactory for each look-and-feel
standard.  Each subclass implements the operations to create the
appropriate widget for the look and feel.  For example, the
CreateScrollBar operation on the MotifWidgetFactory instantiates and
returns a Motif scroll bar, while the corresponding operation on the
PMWidgetFactory returns a scroll bar for Presentation Manager.
Clients create widgets solely through the WidgetFactory interface and
have no knowledge of the classes that implement widgets for a
particular look and feel.  In other words, clients only have to commit
to an interface defined by an abstract class, not a particular
concrete class.</P>

<A NAME="auto1004"></A>
<P>A WidgetFactory also enforces dependencies between the concrete widget
classes.  A Motif scroll bar should be used with a Motif button and a
Motif text editor, and that constraint is enforced automatically as a
consequence of using a MotifWidgetFactory.</P>

<P>The Abstract Factory pattern has the following benefits and liabilities:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1038"></A>
<LI><EM>It isolates concrete classes.</EM>
The Abstract Factory pattern helps you control the classes of objects
that an application creates.  Because a factory encapsulates the
responsibility and the process of creating product objects, it
isolates clients from implementation classes.  Clients manipulate
instances through their abstract interfaces.  Product class names are
isolated in the implementation of the concrete factory; they do not
appear in client code.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1039"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="prodobj-exchange"></A>
<LI><EM>It makes exchanging product families easy.</EM>
The class of a concrete factory appears only once in an
application&#151;that is, where it's instantiated.  This makes it easy to
change the concrete factory an application uses.  It can use
different product configurations simply by changing the concrete
factory. Because an abstract factory creates a complete family of
products, the whole product family changes at once.  In our user
interface example, we can switch from Motif widgets to Presentation
Manager widgets simply by switching the corresponding factory objects
and recreating the interface.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1040"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1041"></A>
<LI><EM>It promotes consistency among products.</EM>
When product objects in a family are designed to work together, it's
important that an application use objects from only one family at a
time.  AbstractFactory makes this easy to enforce.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1042"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1043"></A>
<LI><EM>Supporting new kinds of products is difficult.</EM>
Extending abstract factories to produce new kinds of Products isn't
easy.  That's because the AbstractFactory interface fixes the set of
products that can be created. Supporting new kinds of products
requires extending the factory interface, which involves changing the
AbstractFactory class and all of its subclasses.  We discuss one solution
to this problem in the Implementation section.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1044"></A>
<P>Here are some useful techniques for implementing the Abstract Factory
pattern.</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="single-absfact"></A>
<LI><EM>Factories as singletons.</EM>
An application typically needs only one instance of a ConcreteFactory
per product family.  So it's usually best implemented as a
<A HREF="pat3efs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Singleton (127)</A>.

<A NAME="auto1045"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="prodobj-creat-absfact"></A>
<LI><EM>Creating the products.</EM> AbstractFactory only declares
an <EM>interface</EM> for creating products. It's up to ConcreteProduct
subclasses to actually create them.  The most common way to do this
is to define a factory method (see <A HREF="pat3cfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Factory Method (107)</A>) for each product.  A concrete
factory will specify its products by overriding the factory method
for each.  While this implementation is simple, it requires a new
concrete factory subclass for each product family, even if the
product families differ only slightly.

<A NAME="proto-imp-absfact"></A>
<P>If many product families are possible, the concrete factory can
be implemented using the <A HREF="pat3dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Prototype (117)</A>
pattern.  The concrete factory is initialized with a prototypical
instance of each product in the family, and it creates a new product
by cloning its prototype. The Prototype-based approach eliminates
the need for a new concrete factory class for each new product
family.</P>

<A NAME="auto1046"></A>
<P>Here's a way to implement a Prototype-based factory in Smalltalk.  The
concrete factory stores the prototypes to be cloned in a dictionary
called <CODE>partCatalog</CODE>. The method <CODE>make:</CODE> retrieves the
prototype and clones it:</P>

<A NAME="auto1047"></A>
<PRE>
    make: partName
        ^ (partCatalog at: partName) copy
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1048"></A>
<P>The concrete factory has a method for adding parts to the catalog.</P>

<A NAME="auto1049"></A>
<PRE>
    addPart: partTemplate named: partName
        partCatalog at: partName put: partTemplate
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1050"></A>
<P>Prototypes are added to the factory by identifying them with a symbol:</P>

<A NAME="auto1051"></A>
<PRE>
    aFactory addPart: aPrototype named: #ACMEWidget
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1052"></A>
<P>A variation on the Prototype-based approach is possible in languages
that treat classes as first-class objects (Smalltalk and Objective C,
for example).  You can think of a class in these languages as a
degenerate factory that creates only one kind of product.  You can
store <EM>classes</EM> inside a concrete factory that create the various
concrete products in variables, much like prototypes.  These classes
create new instances on behalf of the concrete factory.  You define a
new factory by initializing an instance of a concrete factory with
<EM>classes</EM> of products rather than by subclassing.  This approach
takes advantage of language characteristics, whereas the pure
Prototype-based approach is language-independent.

<A NAME="auto1053"></A>
<P>Like the Prototype-based factory in Smalltalk just discussed, the
class-based version will have a single instance variable
<CODE>partCatalog</CODE>, which is a dictionary whose key is the name of
the part.  Instead of storing prototypes to be cloned,
<CODE>partCatalog</CODE> stores the classes of the products. The method
<CODE>make:</CODE> now looks like this:</P>

<A NAME="auto1054"></A>
<PRE>
    make: partName
        ^ (partCatalog at: partName) new
</PRE>

</LI>

<A NAME="auto1055"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="extensible"></A>
<LI><EM>Defining extensible factories.</EM>
AbstractFactory usually defines a different operation for each kind of
product it can produce.  The kinds of products are encoded in the
operation signatures.  Adding a new kind of product requires changing
the AbstractFactory interface and all the classes that depend on it.

<A NAME="auto1056"></A>
<P>A more flexible but less safe design is to add a parameter to
operations that create objects.  This parameter specifies the kind of
object to be created.  It could be a class identifier, an integer, a
string, or anything else that identifies the kind of product.  In fact
with this approach, AbstractFactory only needs a single "Make"
operation with a parameter indicating the kind of object to create.
This is the technique used in the Prototype- and the class-based
abstract factories discussed earlier.</P>

<A NAME="auto1057"></A>
<P>This variation is easier to use in a dynamically typed language like
Smalltalk than in a statically typed language like C++.  You can use
it in C++ only when all objects have the same abstract base class or
when the product objects can be safely coerced to the correct type by
the client that requested them.  The implementation section of <A HREF="pat3cfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Factory Method (107)</A> shows how to implement such
parameterized operations in C++.</P>

<A NAME="downcast"></A>
<A NAME="dynamic_cast"></A>
<P>But even when no coercion is needed, an inherent problem remains: All
products are returned to the client with the <EM>same</EM> abstract
interface as given by the return type.  The client will not be able to
differentiate or make safe assumptions about the class of a product.
If clients need to perform subclass-specific operations, they won't be
accessible through the abstract interface.  Although the client could
perform a downcast (e.g., with <CODE>dynamic_cast</CODE> in C++), that's
not always feasible or safe, because the downcast can fail.  This is the
classic trade-off for a highly flexible and extensible interface.</P>

Programs that build mazes take a <CODE>MazeFactory</CODE> as an argument

<CODE>CreateMaze</CODE> hard-codes the class names, making it difficult

<P>Now suppose we want to make a maze game in which a room can have a
bomb set in it.  If the bomb goes off, it will damage the walls (at
least).  We can make a subclass of <CODE>Room</CODE> keep track of
whether the room has a bomb in it and whether the bomb has gone off.
We'll also need a subclass of <CODE>Wall</CODE> to keep track of the
damage done to the wall.  We'll call these classes
<CODE>RoomWithABomb</CODE> and <CODE>BombedWall</CODE>.</P>

<A NAME="auto1065"></A>
<P>The last class we'll define is <CODE>BombedMazeFactory</CODE>, a subclass

<CODE>BombedWall</CODE> and rooms are of class <CODE>RoomWithABomb</CODE>.
<CODE>BombedMazeFactory</CODE> only needs to override two functions:</P>

    Wall* BombedMazeFactory::MakeWall () const {

<A NAME="auto1067"></A>
<P>To build a simple maze that can contain bombs, we simply call
<CODE>CreateMaze</CODE> with a <CODE>BombedMazeFactory</CODE>.</P>

<A NAME="auto1068"></A>

    MazeGame game;
    BombedMazeFactory factory;
    
    game.CreateMaze(factory);

<A NAME="auto1069"></A>
<P><CODE>CreateMaze</CODE> can take an instance of
<CODE>EnchantedMazeFactory</CODE> just as well to build enchanted
mazes.</P>

<A NAME="auto1070"></A>
<P>Notice that the <CODE>MazeFactory</CODE> is just a collection of factory
methods.  This is the most common way to implement the Abstract
Factory pattern.  Also note that <CODE>MazeFactory</CODE> is not an
abstract class; thus it acts as both the AbstractFactory <EM>and</EM> the
ConcreteFactory.  This is another common implementation for simple
applications of the Abstract Factory pattern.  Because the <CODE>MazeFactory</CODE> is a concrete class consisting
entirely of factory methods, it's easy to make a new
<CODE>MazeFactory</CODE> by making a subclass and overriding the
operations that need to change.</P>

<CODE>CreateMaze</CODE> used the <CODE>SetSide</CODE> operation on rooms to
specify their sides.  If it creates rooms with a
<CODE>BombedMazeFactory</CODE>, then the maze will be made up of
<CODE>RoomWithABomb</CODE> objects with <CODE>BombedWall</CODE> sides.  If
<CODE>RoomWithABomb</CODE> had to access a subclass-specific member of
<CODE>BombedWall</CODE>, then it would have to cast a
reference to its walls from <CODE>Wall*</CODE> to
<CODE>BombedWall*</CODE>.  This downcasting is safe as long as the argument
<EM>is</EM> in fact a <CODE>BombedWall</CODE>, which is guaranteed to be
true if walls are built solely with a <CODE>BombedMazeFactory</CODE>.</P>

<A NAME="auto1072"></A>
<P>Dynamically typed languages such as Smalltalk don't require downcasting,
of course, but they might produce run-time errors if they encounter a
<CODE>Wall</CODE> where they expect a <EM>subclass</EM> of <CODE>Wall</CODE>.
Using Abstract Factory to build walls helps prevent these run-time
errors by ensuring that only certain kinds of walls can be
created.</P>

<A NAME="auto1073"></A>
<P>Let's consider a Smalltalk version of <CODE>MazeFactory</CODE>, one with
a single <CODE>make</CODE> operation that takes the kind of object to
make as a parameter.  Moreover, the concrete factory stores the
classes of the products it creates.</P>

<A NAME="auto1074"></A>

Smalltalk:</P>

<P>A <CODE>BombedMazeFactory</CODE> or <CODE>EnchantedMazeFactory</CODE> is
created by associating different classes with the keys. For example,
an <CODE>EnchantedMazeFactory</CODE> could be created like this:</P>

<A NAME="auto1081"></A>
<PRE>
    createMazeFactory
        ^ (MazeFactory new
            addPart: Wall named: #wall;
            addPart: EnchantedRoom named: #room;
            addPart: DoorNeedingSpell named: #door;
            yourself)

<P>InterViews uses the "Kit" suffix [<a href="bibfs.htm#interviews_kit" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Lin92</A>] to denote AbstractFactory
classes.  It defines WidgetKit and DialogKit abstract factories
for generating look-and-feel-specific user interface objects.
InterViews also includes a LayoutKit that generates different
composition objects depending on the layout desired.  For example,
a layout that is conceptually horizontal may require different
composition objects depending on the document's orientation (portrait
or landscape).</P>

<P>ET++ [<a href="bibfs.htm#et++" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">WGM88</A>] uses the Abstract Factory pattern to achieve
portability across different window systems (X Windows and SunView,
for example).  The WindowSystem abstract base class defines the
interface for creating objects that represent window system resources
(MakeWindow, MakeFont, MakeColor, for example).  Concrete subclasses
implement the interfaces for a specific window system. At run-time,
ET++ creates an instance of a concrete WindowSystem subclass that
creates concrete system resource objects.</P>

<P>AbstractFactory classes are often implemented with factory
methods (<A HREF="pat3cfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Factory
Method (107)</A>), but they can also be implemented using <A
HREF="pat3dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Prototype (117)</A>.</P>

<A NAME="auto1084"></A>
<P>A concrete factory is often a singleton (<A HREF="pat3efs.htm"
TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Singleton (127)</A>).
