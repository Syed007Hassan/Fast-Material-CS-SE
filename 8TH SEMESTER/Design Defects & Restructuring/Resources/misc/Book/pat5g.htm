<A NAME="auto1002"></A>
<P>A common side-effect of partitioning a system into a collection of
cooperating classes is the need to maintain consistency between
related objects.  You don't want to achieve consistency by making the
classes tightly coupled, because that reduces their reusability.</P>

<A NAME="auto1003"></A>
<P>For example, many graphical user interface toolkits separate the
presentational aspects of the user interface from the underlying
application data [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#krasner_mvc" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">KP88</A>, <A HREF="bibfs.htm#interviews_composition" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">LVC89</A>, <A HREF="bibfs.htm#atk" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">P+88</A>, <A HREF="bibfs.htm#et++" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">WGM88</A>].
Classes defining application data and presentations can be reused
independently. They can work together, too. Both a spreadsheet object
and bar chart object can depict information in the same application data
object using different presentations. The spreadsheet and the bar chart
don't know about each other, thereby letting you reuse only the one you
need. But they <EM>behave</EM> as though they do. When the user changes the
information in the spreadsheet, the bar chart reflects the changes
immediately, and vice versa.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/obser023.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1004"></A>
<P>This behavior implies that the spreadsheet and bar chart are dependent
on the data object and therefore should be notified of any change in
its state.  And there's no reason to limit the number of dependent
objects to two; there may be any number of different user interfaces
to the same data.</P>

<A NAME="def-subject"></A>
<P>The Observer pattern describes how to establish these relationships.
The key objects in this pattern are <STRONG>subject</STRONG> and
<STRONG>observer</STRONG>.  A subject may have any number of dependent
observers.  All observers are notified whenever the subject undergoes
a change in state. In response, each observer will query the subject
to synchronize its state with the subject's state.</P>

<A NAME="auto1005"></A>
<P>This kind of interaction is also known as
<STRONG>publish-subscribe</STRONG>. The subject is the publisher of
notifications. It sends out these notifications without having to know
who its observers are. Any number of observers can subscribe to
receive notifications.</P>

<LI><EM>Abstract coupling between Subject and Observer.</EM>
All a subject knows is that it has a list of observers, each
conforming to the simple interface of the abstract Observer class.
The subject doesn't know the concrete class of any observer.  Thus the
coupling between subjects and observers is abstract and minimal.

<A NAME="auto1043"></A>
<P>Because Subject and Observer aren't tightly coupled, they can belong to
different layers of abstraction in a system.  A lower-level subject
can communicate and inform a higher-level observer, thereby keeping the
system's layering intact.  If Subject and Observer are lumped
together, then the resulting object must either span two layers (and
violate the layering), or it must be forced to live in one layer or
the other (which might compromise the layering abstraction).</P>

<LI><EM>Support for broadcast communication.</EM>
Unlike an ordinary request, the notification that a subject sends
needn't specify its receiver.  The notification is broadcast
automatically to all interested objects that subscribed to it. The
subject doesn't care how many interested objects exist; its only
responsibility is to notify its observers.  This gives you the freedom
to add and remove observers at any time.  It's up to the observer to
handle or ignore a notification.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1046"></A>

<A NAME="update-limit"></A>
<LI><EM>Unexpected updates.</EM>
Because observers have no knowledge of each other's presence, they can
be blind to the ultimate cost of changing the subject.  A seemingly
innocuous operation on the subject may cause a cascade of updates to
observers and their dependent objects.  Moreover, dependency criteria
that aren't well-defined or maintained usually lead to spurious
updates, which can be hard to track down.

<A NAME="update-protocol"></A>
<P>This problem is aggravated by the fact that the simple update protocol

<A NAME="subj-map-obsrv"></A>
<LI><EM>Mapping subjects to their observers.</EM>
The simplest way for a subject to keep track of the observers it
should notify is to store references to them explicitly in the
subject.  However, such storage may be too expensive when there are
many subjects and few observers.  One solution is to trade space for
time by using an associative look-up (e.g., a hash table) to maintain
the subject-to-observer mapping.  Thus a subject with no observers
does not incur storage overhead.  On the other hand, this approach
increases the cost of accessing the observers.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1048"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="subj-mult-obsrv"></A>
<LI><EM>Observing more than one subject.</EM>
It might make sense in some situations for an observer to depend on
more than one subject.  For example, a spreadsheet may depend on more
than one data source.  It's necessary to extend the Update interface
in such cases to let the observer know <EM>which</EM> subject is sending
the notification.  The subject can simply pass itself as a parameter
in the Update operation, thereby letting the observer know which
subject to examine.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1049"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="update-trigger"></A>
<LI><EM>Who triggers the update?</EM>
The subject and its observers rely on the notification mechanism to
stay consistent.  But what object actually calls Notify to trigger the
update?  Here are two options:</LI>

<A NAME="auto1050"></A>
<P></P>

<OL TYPE=a>

<A NAME="auto1051"></A>
<LI>Have state-setting operations on Subject call Notify after they
change the subject's state.  The advantage of this approach is that
clients don't have to remember to call Notify on the subject.  The
disadvantage is that several consecutive operations will cause
several consecutive updates, which may be inefficient.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1052"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1053"></A>
<LI>Make clients responsible for calling Notify at the right time.
The advantage here is that the client can wait to trigger the update
until after a series of state changes has been made, thereby
avoiding needless intermediate updates.  The disadvantage is that
clients have an added responsibility to trigger the update.  That
makes errors more likely, since clients might forget to call Notify.</LI>

</OL>

<A NAME="auto1054"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="subj-avoid-dangle"></A>
<LI><EM>Dangling references to deleted subjects.</EM>
Deleting a subject should not produce dangling references in its
observers.  One way to avoid dangling references is to make the
subject notify its observers as it is deleted so that they can reset
their reference to it.  In general, simply deleting the observers is not 
an option, because other objects may reference them, or they may be
observing other subjects as well.</LI>
<A NAME="auto1055"></A>
<P></P>
<A NAME="auto1056"></A>
<LI><EM>Making sure Subject state is self-consistent before
notification.</EM>
It's important to make sure Subject state is self-consistent before
calling Notify, because observers query the subject for its current
state in the course of updating their own state.

<A NAME="auto1057"></A>
<P>This self-consistency rule is easy to violate unintentionally when
Subject subclass operations call inherited operations.  For example,
the notification in the following code sequence is trigged when the
subject is in an inconsistent state:</P>

<A NAME="auto1058"></A>
<PRE>
    void MySubject::Operation (int newValue) {
        BaseClassSubject::Operation(newValue);
            // trigger notification
    
        _myInstVar += newValue;
            // update subclass state (too late!)
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1059"></A>
<P>You can avoid this pitfall by sending notifications from template
methods (<A HREF="pat5jfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Template Method (325)</A>) in abstract Subject
classes. Define a primitive operation for subclasses to override, and make
Notify the last operation in the template method, which will ensure that
the object is self-consistent when subclasses override Subject
operations.</P>

<A NAME="auto1060"></A>
<PRE>
    void Text::Cut (TextRange r) {
         ReplaceRange(r);       // redefined in subclasses
         Notify();
    }

trigger notifications.</P>

<LI><EM>Avoiding observer-specific update protocols: the push
and pull models.</EM> Implementations of the Observer pattern often have
the subject broadcast additional information about the change.  The
subject passes this information as an argument to Update.  The amount
of information may vary widely.

<A NAME="pullmodel"></A>
<A NAME="pushmodel"></A>
<P>At one extreme, which we call the <STRONG>push model</STRONG>, the subject
sends observers detailed information about the change, whether they
want it or not.  At the other extreme is the <STRONG>pull model</STRONG>;
the subject sends nothing but the most minimal notification, and
observers ask for details explicitly thereafter.</P>

<A NAME="auto1064"></A>
<P>The pull model emphasizes the subject's ignorance of its observers,
whereas the push model assumes subjects know something about their
observers' needs.  The push model might make observers less reusable,
because Subject classes make assumptions about Observer classes that
might not always be true.  On the other hand, the pull model may be
inefficient, because Observer classes must ascertain what changed
without help from the Subject.</P>

<A NAME="aspect"></A>
<LI><EM>Specifying modifications of interest explicitly.</EM>
You can improve update efficiency by extending the subject's
registration interface to allow registering observers only for
specific events of interest. When such an event occurs, the subject
informs only those observers that have registered interest in that
event. One way to support this uses the notion of
<STRONG>aspects</STRONG> for Subject objects. To register
interest in particular events, observers are attached to their
subjects using

<A NAME="auto1066"></A>
<PRE>
    void Subject::Attach(Observer*, Aspect&amp; interest);
</PRE>

<A NAME="auto1067"></A>
<P>where <CODE>interest</CODE> specifies the event
of interest.  At notification time, the subject supplies the changed
aspect to its observers as a parameter to the Update operation.  For
example:</P>

<A NAME="auto1068"></A>

When the dependency relationship between subjects and observers is
particularly complex, an object that maintains these relationships might
be required.  We call such an object a <STRONG>ChangeManager</STRONG>.  Its
purpose is to minimize the work required to make observers reflect a
change in their subject.  For example, if an operation involves
changes to several interdependent subjects, you might have to
ensure that their observers are notified only after <EM>all</EM> the

the Observer pattern. There are two specialized ChangeManagers.
SimpleChangeManager is naive in that it always updates all observers of
each subject. In contrast, DAGChangeManager handles directed-acyclic
graphs of dependencies between subjects and their observers. A
DAGChangeManager is preferable to a SimpleChangeManager when an observer
observes more than one subject. In that case, a change in two or more
subjects might cause redundant updates. The DAGChangeManager ensures
the observer receives just one update. SimpleChangeManager is
fine when multiple updates aren't an issue.</P>

<P>The following code creates an <CODE>AnalogClock</CODE> and a
<CODE>DigitalClock</CODE> that always show the same time:</P>

<A NAME="auto1092"></A>
<PRE>
    ClockTimer* timer = new ClockTimer;

<P>Whenever the <CODE>timer</CODE> ticks, the two clocks will be updated
and will redisplay themselves appropriately.</P>

<A NAME="smalltalk-use-observe"></A>
<A NAME="think-use-obsrv"></A>
<P>The first and perhaps best-known example of the Observer pattern appears
in Smalltalk Model/View/Controller (MVC), the user interface framework in the Smalltalk
environment [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#krasner_mvc" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">KP88</A>]. MVC's Model class plays the role of
Subject, while View is the base class for observers. Smalltalk,
ET++ [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#et++" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">WGM88</A>], and the THINK class library [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#think" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Sym93b</A>] provide a
general dependency mechanism by putting Subject and Observer interfaces
in the parent class for all other classes in the system.</P>

<A NAME="toolkit"></A>
<A NAME="unidraw-use-observ"></A>
<P>Other user interface toolkits that employ this pattern are
InterViews [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#interviews_composition" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">LVC89</A>], the Andrew
Toolkit [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#atk" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">P+88</A>], and Unidraw [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#unidraw_framework" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">VL90</A>]. InterViews
defines Observer and Observable (for subjects) classes explicitly.
Andrew calls them "view" and "data object," respectively. Unidraw
splits graphical editor objects into View (for observers) and Subject
parts.</P>
