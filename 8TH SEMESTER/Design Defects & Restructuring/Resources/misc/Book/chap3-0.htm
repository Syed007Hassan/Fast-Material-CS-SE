<P>Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process.
They help make a system independent of how its objects are created,
composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance
to vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object creational
pattern will delegate instantiation to another object.

<A NAME="creation_top2"></A>

<P>Creational patterns become important as systems evolve to depend more
on object composition than class inheritance. As that happens,
emphasis shifts away from hard-coding a fixed set of behaviors toward
defining a smaller set of fundamental behaviors that can be composed
into any number of more complex ones. Thus creating objects with
particular behaviors requires more than simply instantiating a class.

<A NAME="creation_top2"></A>

<P>There are two recurring themes in these patterns. First, they all
encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.
Second, they hide how instances of these classes are created and put
together. All the system at large knows about the objects is their
interfaces as defined by abstract classes. Consequently, the
creational patterns give you a lot of flexibility in <EM>what</EM> gets
created, <EM>who</EM> creates it, <EM>how</EM> it gets created, and <EM>when</EM>. They let you configure a system with "product" objects that
vary widely in structure and functionality.  Configuration can be
static (that is, specified at compile-time) or dynamic (at
run-time).

<A NAME="creation_top3"></A>

<P>Sometimes creational patterns are competitors. For example,
there are cases when either <A HREF="pat3dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Prototype (117)</A>
or <A HREF="pat3afs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Abstract Factory (87)</A> could
be used profitably. At other times they are complementary:
<A HREF="pat3bfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Builder (97)</A> can use one of the other
patterns to implement which components get built.
<A HREF="pat3dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Prototype (117)</A> can use
<A HREF="pat3efs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Singleton (127)</A> in its implementation.

<A NAME="creation_top4"></A>

<P>Because the creational patterns are closely related, we'll study all
five of them together to highlight their similarities and differences.
We'll also use a common example&#151;building a maze for a computer
game&#151;to illustrate their implementations. The maze and the game will
vary slightly from pattern to pattern. Sometimes the game will be
simply to find your way out of a maze; in that case the player will
probably only have a local view of the maze. Sometimes mazes contain
problems to solve and dangers to overcome, and these games may provide
a map of the part of the maze that has been explored.

<A NAME="creation_top5"></A>

<P>We'll ignore many details of what can be in a maze and whether a maze
game has a single or multiple players. Instead, we'll just focus on
how mazes get created. We define a maze as a set of rooms. A room
knows its neighbors; possible neighbors are another room, a wall, or a
door to another room.

<A NAME="creation_top6"></A>

<P>The classes <CODE>Room</CODE>, <CODE>Door</CODE>, and <CODE>Wall</CODE>
define the components of the maze used in all our examples. We define
only the parts of these classes that are important for creating a
maze.  We'll ignore players, operations for displaying and wandering
around in a maze, and other important functionality that isn't
relevant to building the maze.

<P>The following diagram shows the relationships between these classes:

<A NAME="room-82c"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/maze.gif"></P>

<P>Each room has four sides. We use an enumeration <CODE>Direction</CODE> in
C++ implementations to specify the north, south, east, and west sides of
a room:</P>

<PRE>
    enum Direction {North, South, East, West};
</PRE>

<P>The Smalltalk implementations use corresponding symbols to represent
these directions.</P>

<A NAME="mapsite"></A>
<P>The class <CODE>MapSite</CODE> is the common abstract class for all the
components of a maze. To simplify the example, <CODE>MapSite</CODE> defines
only one operation, <CODE>Enter</CODE>. Its meaning depends on what you're
entering. If you enter a room, then your location changes. If you try to
enter a door, then one of two things happen: If the door is open, you go
into the next room. If the door is closed, then you hurt your nose.</P>

<PRE>
    class MapSite {
    public:
        virtual void Enter() = 0;
    };
</PRE>

<A NAME="mapsite2"></A>

<P><CODE>Enter</CODE> provides a simple basis for more sophisticated game
operations. For example, if you are in a room and say "Go East," the
game can simply determine which <CODE>MapSite</CODE> is immediately to the
east and then call <CODE>Enter</CODE> on it. The subclass-specific
<CODE>Enter</CODE> operation will figure out whether your location changed
or your nose got hurt. In a real game, <CODE>Enter</CODE> could take the
player object that's moving about as an argument.</P>

<A NAME="def-room"></A>
<P><CODE>Room</CODE> is the concrete subclass of <CODE>MapSite</CODE> that
defines the key relationships between components in the maze. It
maintains references to other <CODE>MapSite</CODE> objects and stores a
room number. The number will identify rooms in the maze.</P>

<PRE>
    class Room : public MapSite {
    public:
        Room(int roomNo);
    
        MapSite* GetSide(Direction) const;
        void SetSide(Direction, MapSite*);
    
        virtual void Enter();
    
    private:
        MapSite* _sides[4];
        int _roomNumber;
    };
</PRE>

<A NAME="wall-code"></A>
<A NAME="door-code"></A>
<P>The following classes represent the wall or door that occurs on each
side of a room.</P>

<PRE>
    class Wall : public MapSite {
    public:
        Wall();
    
        virtual void Enter();
    };
    
    class Door : public MapSite {
    public:
        Door(Room* = 0, Room* = 0);
    
        virtual void Enter();
        Room* OtherSideFrom(Room*);
    
    private:
        Room* _room1;
        Room* _room2;
        bool _isOpen;
    };
</PRE>

<A NAME="Door-def"></A>
<A NAME="maze-def"></A>
<P>We need to know about more than just the parts of a maze. We'll also
define a <CODE>Maze</CODE> class to represent a collection of rooms.
<CODE>Maze</CODE> can also find a particular room given a room number
using its <CODE>RoomNo</CODE> operation.</P>

<PRE>
    class Maze {
    public:
        Maze();
    
        void AddRoom(Room*);
        Room* RoomNo(int) const;
    private:
        // ...
    };
</PRE>

<P><CODE>RoomNo</CODE> could do a look-up using a linear search, a hash table,
or even a simple array. But we won't worry about such details here.
Instead, we'll focus on how to specify the components of a maze object.</P>

<A NAME="mazegame"></A>
<P>Another class we define is <CODE>MazeGame</CODE>, which creates the maze.
One straightforward way to create a maze is with a series of operations
that add components to a maze and then interconnect them.  For
example, the following member function will create a maze consisting
of two rooms with a door between them:</P>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-def"></A>
<PRE>
    Maze* MazeGame::CreateMaze () {
        Maze* aMaze = new Maze;
        Room* r1 = new Room(1);
        Room* r2 = new Room(2);
        Door* theDoor = new Door(r1, r2);
    
        aMaze->AddRoom(r1);
        aMaze->AddRoom(r2);
    
        r1->SetSide(North, new Wall);
        r1->SetSide(East, theDoor);
        r1->SetSide(South, new Wall);
        r1->SetSide(West, new Wall);
    
        r2->SetSide(North, new Wall);
        r2->SetSide(East, new Wall);
        r2->SetSide(South, new Wall);
        r2->SetSide(West, theDoor);
    
        return aMaze;
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-text1"></A>

<P>This function is pretty complicated, considering that all it does is create
a maze with two rooms. There are obvious ways to make it simpler. For
example, the <CODE>Room</CODE> constructor could initialize the sides
with walls ahead of time. But that just moves the code somewhere else.
The real problem with this member function isn't its size but its <EM>inflexibility</EM>. It hard-codes the maze layout. Changing the layout
means changing this member function, either by overriding it&#151;which
means reimplementing the whole thing&#151;or by changing parts of
it&#151;which is error-prone and doesn't promote reuse.</P>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-text2"></A>

<P>The creational patterns show how to make this design more <EM>flexible</EM>, not necessarily smaller. In particular, they will make it
easy to change the classes that define the components of a maze.</P>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-text2"></A>

<P>Suppose you wanted to reuse an existing maze layout for a new game
containing (of all things) enchanted mazes. The enchanted maze game has
new kinds of components, like <CODE>DoorNeedingSpell</CODE>, a door that
can be locked and opened subsequently only with a spell; and
<CODE>EnchantedRoom</CODE>, a room that can have unconventional items in
it, like magic keys or spells. How can you change <CODE>CreateMaze</CODE>
easily so that it creates mazes with these new classes of objects?</P>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-text3"></A>

<P>In this case, the biggest barrier to change lies in hard-coding the
classes that get instantiated. The creational patterns provide
different ways to remove explicit references to concrete classes
from code that needs to instantiate them:</P>

<UL>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-text4"></A>

<LI>If <CODE>CreateMaze</CODE> calls virtual functions instead of constructor
calls to create the rooms, walls, and doors it requires, then you can
change the classes that get instantiated by making a subclass of
<CODE>MazeGame</CODE> and redefining those virtual functions. This approach
is an example of the
<A HREF="pat3cfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Factory Method (107)</A> pattern.</LI>

<P></P>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-text5"></A>

<LI>If <CODE>CreateMaze</CODE> is passed an object as a parameter to use to
create rooms, walls, and doors, then you can change the classes of
rooms, walls, and doors by passing a different parameter. This is an
example of the <A HREF="pat3afs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Abstract Factory (87)</A> pattern.</LI>

<P></P>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-text6"></A>

<LI>If <CODE>CreateMaze</CODE> is passed an object that can create a new maze
in its entirety using operations for adding rooms, doors, and walls to
the maze it builds, then you can use inheritance to change parts of
the maze or the way the maze is built. This is an example of the
<A HREF="pat3bfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Builder (97)</A> pattern.</LI>

<P></P>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-text7"></A>

<LI>If <CODE>CreateMaze</CODE> is parameterized by various prototypical room,
door, and wall objects, which it then copies and adds to the maze,
then you can change the maze's composition by replacing these
prototypical objects with different ones. This is an example of the
<A HREF="pat3dfs.htm" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Prototype (117)</A> pattern.</LI>

</UL>

<A NAME="CreateMaze-text8"></A>

<P>The remaining creational pattern, <A HREF="pat3efs.htm"
TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Singleton (127)</A>, can
ensure there's only one maze per game and that all game objects have
ready access to it&#151;without resorting to global variables or
functions.  Singleton also makes it easy to extend or replace the maze
without touching existing code.</P>
