<P>This book isn't an introduction to object-oriented technology or
design.  Many books already do a good job of that.  This book assumes
you are reasonably proficient in at least one object-oriented
programming language, and you should have some experience in
object-oriented design as well.  You definitely shouldn't have to rush
to the nearest dictionary the moment we mention "types" and
"polymorphism," or "interface" as opposed to "implementation"
inheritance.
<A NAME="prefbook2"></A>
<P>On the other hand, this isn't an advanced technical treatise either.
It's a book of <B>design patterns</B> that describes simple and elegant
solutions to specific problems in object-oriented software design.
Design patterns capture solutions that have developed and evolved over
time.  Hence they aren't the designs people tend to generate
initially.  They reflect untold redesign and recoding as developers
have struggled for greater reuse and flexibility in their software.
Design patterns capture these solutions in a succinct and
easily applied form.
<A NAME="prefbook3"></A>
<P>The design patterns require neither unusual language features nor
amazing programming tricks with which to astound your friends and
managers. All can be implemented in standard object-oriented
languages, though they might take a little more work than <EM>ad hoc</EM>
solutions. But the extra effort invariably pays dividends in increased
flexibility and reusability.
<A NAME="prefbook4"></A>
<P>Once you understand the design patterns and have had an "Aha!" (and
not just a "Huh?") experience with them, you won't ever think about
object-oriented design in the same way.  You'll have insights that can
make your own designs more flexible, modular, reusable, and
understandable&#151;which is why you're interested in object-oriented
technology in the first place, right?
<A NAME="prefbook5"></A>
<P>A word of warning and encouragement: Don't worry if you don't
understand this book completely on the first reading.  We didn't
understand it all on the first writing!  Remember that this isn't a
book to read once and put on a shelf.  We hope you'll find yourself
referring to it again and again for design insights and for
inspiration.
<A NAME="prefbook6"></A>
<P>This book has had a long gestation.  It has seen four countries, three
of its authors' marriages, and the birth of two (unrelated) offspring.
Many people have had a part in its development.  Special thanks are
due
Bruce Anderson, 
Kent Beck, and 
Andr&#233; Weinand
for their inspiration and advice.  We also thank those who reviewed
drafts of the manuscript:
Roger Bielefeld,
Grady Booch,
Tom Cargill,
Marshall Cline,
Ralph Hyre,
Brian Kernighan,
Thomas Laliberty,
Mark Lorenz,
Arthur Riel,
Doug Schmidt,
Clovis Tondo,
Steve Vinoski,
and
Rebecca Wirfs-Brock.

We are also grateful to the team at Addison-Wesley for their help and
patience:
Kate Habib,
Tiffany Moore,
Lisa Raffaele,
Pradeepa Siva,
and
John Wait.

Special thanks to Carl Kessler, Danny Sabbah, and Mark Wegman at IBM
Research for their unflagging support of this work.
<A NAME="prefbook7"></A>
<P>Last but certainly not least, we thank everyone on the Internet and
points beyond who commented on versions of the patterns, offered
encouraging words, and told us that what we were doing was worthwhile.
These people include but are not limited to

<P>We don't consider this collection of design patterns complete and
static; it's more a recording of our current thoughts on design.  We
welcome comments on it, whether criticisms of our examples, references
and known uses we've missed, or design patterns we should have
included.  You can write us care of Addison-Wesley, or send electronic
mail to <A HREF="mailto:design-patterns@cs.uiuc.edu"><CODE>design-patterns@cs.uiuc.edu</CODE></A>.  You can also obtain
softcopy for the code in the Sample Code sections by sending the
message "send design pattern source" to 
<A HREF="mailto:design-patterns-source@cs.uiuc.edu"><CODE>design-patterns-source@cs.uiuc.edu</CODE></A>.  And now there's a Web page
