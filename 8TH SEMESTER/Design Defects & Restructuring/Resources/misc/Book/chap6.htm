<P>It's possible to argue that this book hasn't accomplished much.  After
all, it doesn't present any algorithms or programming techniques that
haven't been used before.  It doesn't give a rigorous method for
designing systems, nor does it develop a new theory of design&#151;it
just documents existing designs.  You could conclude that it
makes a reasonable tutorial, perhaps, but it certainly can't offer
much to an experienced object-oriented designer.</P>

<A NAME="benefits"></A>
<P>We hope you think differently.  Cataloging design patterns is
important.  It gives us standard names and definitions for the
techniques we use.  If we don't study design patterns in software, we
won't be able to improve them, and it'll be harder to come up with new
ones.</P>

<A NAME="auto1000"></A>
<P>This book is only a start.  It contains some of the most common design
patterns that expert object-oriented designers use, and yet people
hear and learn about them solely by word of mouth or by studying
existing systems.  Early drafts of the book prompted other people to
write down the design patterns they use, and it should prompt even
more in its current form.  We hope this will mark the start of a
movement to document the expertise of software practitioners.</P>

<A NAME="auto1001"></A>
<P>This chapter discusses the impact we think design patterns will
have, how they are related to other work in design, and how you can
get involved in finding and cataloging patterns.</P>

<H2><A HREF="#sec6-2"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: A Brief History"></A>
What to Expect from Design Patterns</H2>

<A NAME="auto1002"></A>
<P>Here are several ways in which the design patterns in this book can
affect the way you design object-oriented software, based on our
day-to-day experience with them.</P>

<A NAME="common-vocab"></A>
<H3>A Common Design Vocabulary</H3>

<A NAME="auto1003"></A>
<P>Studies of expert programmers for conventional languages have
shown that knowledge and experience isn't organized simply around
syntax but in larger conceptual structures such as algorithms, data
structures and idioms [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#adelson-soloway_domain" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">AS85</A>, <A HREF="bibfs.htm#coplien_idioms" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Cop92</A>, <A HREF="bibfs.htm#curtis_cognitive" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Cur89</A>, <A HREF="bibfs.htm#spopher-soloway_mistakes" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">SS86</A>], and plans for fulfilling a particular
goal [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#soloway-erlich_empirical" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">SE84</A>].
Designers probably don't think about the notation they're using
for recording the design as much as they try to match the current
design situation against plans, algorithms, data structures, and
idioms they have learned in the past.</P>

<A NAME="despatt-doc"></A>
<P>Computer scientists name and catalog algorithms and data structures,
but we don't often name other kinds of patterns.  Design patterns
provide a common vocabulary for designers to use to communicate, document,
and explore design alternatives.  Design patterns make a system seem
less complex by letting you talk about it at a higher level of
abstraction than that of a design notation or programming language.
Design patterns raise the level at which you design and discuss design
with your colleagues.</P>

<A NAME="auto1004"></A>
<P>Once you've absorbed the design patterns in this book, your design
vocabulary will almost certainly change. You will speak directly in
terms of the names of the design patterns.  You'll find yourself
saying things like, "Let's use an Observer here," or, "Let's make a
Strategy out of these classes."</P>

<A NAME="design-docpatt"></A>
<H3>A Documentation and Learning Aid</H3>

<A NAME="auto1005"></A>
<P>Knowing the design patterns in this book makes it easier to understand
existing systems.  Most large object-oriented systems use these design
patterns.  People learning object-oriented programming often complain
that the systems they're working with use inheritance in convoluted
ways and that it's difficult to follow the flow of control.  In large
part this is because they do not understand the design patterns in the
system.  Learning these design patterns will help you understand
existing object-oriented systems.</P>

<A NAME="auto1006"></A>
<P>These design patterns can also make you a better designer.  They
provide solutions to common problems.  If you work with
object-oriented systems long enough, you'll probably learn these
design patterns on your own.  But reading the book will help you learn
them much faster.  Learning these patterns will help a novice act more
like an expert.</P>

<A NAME="auto1007"></A>
<P>Moreover, describing a system in terms of the design patterns that it
uses will make it a lot easier to understand.  Otherwise, people will
have to reverse-engineer the design to unearth the patterns it uses.
Having a common vocabulary means you don't have to describe the whole
design pattern; you can just name it and expect your reader to know
it.  A reader who doesn't know the patterns will have to look them up
at first, but that's still easier than reverse-engineering.</P>

<A NAME="auto1008"></A>
<P>We use these patterns in our own designs, and we've found them
invaluable.  Yet we use the patterns in arguably naive ways.  We use
them to pick names for classes, to think about and teach good design,
and to describe designs in terms of the sequence of design patterns we
applied [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#beck-johnson_ecoop94" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">BJ94</A>].  It's easy to imagine more
sophisticated ways of using patterns, such as pattern-based CASE tools
or hypertext documents.  But patterns are a big help even without
sophisticated tools.</P>


<A NAME="design-obj-mod"></A>
<A NAME="design-adjunct"></A>
<H3>An Adjunct to Existing Methods</H3>

<A NAME="auto1009"></A>
<P>Object-oriented design methods are supposed to promote good design, to
teach new designers how to design well, and to standardize the way
designs are developed.  A design method typically defines a set of
notations (usually graphical) for modeling various aspects of a design,
along with a set of rules that govern how and when to use each
notation.  Design methods usually describe problems that occur in a
design, how to resolve them, and how to evaluate design.  But they
haven't been able to capture the experience of expert designers.</P>

<A NAME="auto1010"></A>
<P>We believe our design patterns are an important piece that's been
missing from object-oriented design methods.  The design patterns show
how to use primitive techniques such as objects, inheritance, and
polymorphism.  They show how to parameterize a system with an
algorithm, a behavior, a state, or the kind of objects it's supposed
to create.  Design patterns provide a way to describe more of the
"why" of a design and not just record the results of your decisions.
The Applicability, Consequences, and Implementation sections of the
design patterns help guide you in the decisions you have to make.</P>

<A NAME="objectmodel"></A>
<P>Design patterns are especially useful in turning an analysis model
into an implementation model.  Despite many claims that promise a
smooth transition from object-oriented analysis to design, in practice
the transition is anything but smooth. A flexible and reusable design
will contain objects that aren't in the analysis model.  The
programming language and class libraries you use affect the design.
Analysis models often must be redesigned to make them reusable.  Many
of the design patterns in the catalog address these issues, which is
why we call them <EM>design</EM> patterns.</P>

<A NAME="auto1011"></A>
<P>A full-fledged design method requires more kinds of patterns than just
design patterns.  There can also be analysis patterns, user interface
design patterns, or performance-tuning patterns.  But the design
patterns are an essential part, one that's been missing until now.</P>

<A NAME="despatt-refactor"></A>
<A NAME="refactor"></A>
<H3>A Target for Refactoring</H3>

<A NAME="auto1012"></A>
<P>One of the problems in developing reusable software is that it
often has to be reorganized or <STRONG>refactored</STRONG> [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#opdyke-johnson_refactoring" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">OJ90</A>].  Design
patterns help you determine how to reorganize a design, and they
can reduce the amount of refactoring you need to do later.</P>

<A NAME="exp-phase1"></A>
<A NAME="foote"></A>
<A NAME="proto-phase"></A>
<P>The lifecycle of object-oriented software has several phases.
Brian Foote identifies these phases as the <STRONG>prototyping</STRONG>,
<STRONG>expansionary</STRONG>, and <STRONG>consolidating</STRONG>
phases [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#Foote-Fractal" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Foo92</A>].</P>

<A NAME="auto1013"></A>
<P>The prototyping phase is a flurry of activity as the software is
brought to life through rapid prototyping and incremental changes,
until it meets an initial set of requirements and reaches adolescence.
At this point, the software usually consists of class hierarchies that
closely reflect entities in the initial problem domain.  The main kind
of reuse is white-box reuse by inheritance.</P>

<A NAME="exp-phase2"></A>
<P>Once the software has reached adolescence and is put into service, its
evolution is governed by two conflicting needs: (1) the software must
satisfy more requirements, and (2) the software must be more reusable.
New requirements usually add new classes and operations and perhaps
whole class hierarchies. The software goes through an expansionary
phase to meet new requirements.  This can't continue for long,
however.  Eventually the software will become too inflexible and
arthritic for further change.  The class hierarchies will no longer
match any problem domain.  Instead they'll reflect many problem
domains, and classes will define many unrelated operations and
instance variables.</P>

<A NAME="blackbox-reuse"></A>
<A NAME="whitebox-reuse"></A>
<P>To continue to evolve, the software must be reorganized in a process
known as <EM>refactoring</EM>.  This is the phase in which frameworks
often emerge.  Refactoring involves tearing apart classes into special-
and general-purpose components, moving operations up or down the class
hierarchy, and rationalizing the interfaces of classes.  This
consolidation phase produces many new kinds of objects, often by
decomposing existing objects and using object composition instead of
inheritance.  Hence black-box reuse replaces white-box reuse.  The
continual need to satisfy more requirements along with the need for
more reuse propels object-oriented software through repeated phases of
expansion and consolidation&#151;expansion as new requirements are
satisfied, and consolidation as the software becomes more general.</P>

<A NAME="lifecycle-gif"></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Pictures/lifec036.gif"></P>

<A NAME="auto1014"></A>
<P>This cycle is unavoidable.  But good designers are aware of the
changes that can prompt refactorings.  Good designers also know class
and object structures that can help avoid refactorings&#151;their designs
are robust in the face of requirement changes.  A thorough
requirements analysis will highlight those requirements that are
likely to change during the life of the software, and a good design
will be robust to them.</P>

<A NAME="auto1015"></A>
<P>Our design patterns capture many of the structures that result from
refactoring.  Using these patterns early in the life of a design
prevents later refactorings.  But even if you don't see how to apply a
pattern until after you've built your system, the pattern can
still show you how to change it.  Design patterns thus provide targets
for your refactorings.</P>

<A NAME="sec6-2"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#sec6-3"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: The Pattern 
Community"></A> A Brief History</H2>

<A NAME="auto1016"></A>
<P>The catalog began as a part of Erich's Ph.D.
thesis [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#gamma_thesis" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Gam91</A>, <A HREF="bibfs.htm#gamma_thesis-book" TARGET="_mainDisp
layFrame">Gam92</A>].  Roughly half of the
current patterns were in his thesis.  By OOPSLA '91 it was officially
an independent catalog, and Richard had joined Erich to work on it.
John started working on it soon thereafter.  By OOPSLA '92, Ralph had
joined the group.  We worked hard to make the catalog fit for
publication at ECOOP '93, but soon we realized that a 90-page paper
was not going to be accepted.  So we summarized the catalog and
submitted the summary, which was accepted.  We decided to turn the
catalog into a book shortly thereafter.</P>

<A NAME="auto1017"></A>
<P>Our names for the patterns have changed a little along the way.
"Wrapper" became "Decorator," "Glue" became "Facade,"
"Solitaire" became "Singleton," and "Walker" became "Visitor."
A couple of patterns got dropped because they didn't seem important
enough. But otherwise the set of patterns in the catalog has changed
little since the end of 1992.  The patterns themselves, however, have
evolved tremendously.</P>

<A NAME="despatt-finding"></A>
<P>In fact, noticing that something is a pattern is the easy part.
All four of us are actively working on building object-oriented
systems, and we've found that it's easy to spot patterns when you
look at enough systems.  But <EM>finding</EM> patterns is much
easier than <EM>describing</EM> them.</P>

<A NAME="auto1018"></A>
<P>If you build systems and then reflect on what you build, you will see
patterns in what you do.  But it's hard to describe patterns so that
people who don't know them will understand them and realize why they
are important.  Experts immediately recognized the value of the
catalog in its early stages.  But the only ones who could understand
the patterns were those who had already used them.</P>

<A NAME="auto1019"></A>
<P>Since one of the main purposes of the book was to teach
object-oriented design to new designers, we knew we had to improve the
catalog.  We expanded the average size of a pattern from less than 2
to more than 10 pages by including a detailed motivating example and sample
code.  We also started examining the trade-offs and the various ways
of implementing the pattern.  This made the patterns easier to learn.</P>

<A NAME="auto1020"></A>
<P>Another important change over the past year has been a greater emphasis on
the problem that a pattern solves.  It's easiest to see a pattern as a
solution, as a technique that can be adapted and reused.  It's harder
to see when it is <EM>appropriate</EM>&#151;to characterize the problems it
solves and the context in which it's the best solution.  In general,
it's easier to see <EM>what</EM> someone is doing than to know <EM>why</EM>,
and the "why" for a pattern is the problem it solves.  Knowing
the purpose of a pattern is important too, because it helps us choose
patterns to apply.  It also helps us understand the design of existing
systems.  A pattern author must determine and characterize the problem
that the pattern solves, even if you have to do it after you've
discovered its solution.</P>

<A NAME="sec6-3"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#sec6-4"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: An Invitation"></A>
The Pattern Community</H2>

<A NAME="auto1021"></A>
<P>We aren't the only ones interested in writing books that catalog the
patterns experts use.  We are a part of a larger community interested
in patterns in general and software-related patterns in particular.
Christopher Alexander is the architect who first studied patterns in
buildings and communities and developed a "pattern language" for
generating them.  His work has inspired us time and again.  So it's
fitting and worthwhile to compare our work to his.  Then we'll look at
others' work in software-related patterns.</P>

<A NAME="alexander"></A>

<H3>Alexander's Pattern Languages</H3>

<A NAME="auto1022"></A>
<P>There are many ways in which our work is like Alexander's.  Both are
based on observing existing systems and looking for patterns in them.
Both have templates for describing patterns (although our templates are
quite different).  Both rely on natural language and lots of examples
to describe patterns rather than formal languages, and both give
rationales for each pattern.</P>

<A NAME="auto1023"></A>
<P>But there are just as many ways in which our works are different:</P>

<OL>

<A NAME="auto1024"></A>
<LI>People have been making buildings for thousands of years, and there
are many classic examples to draw upon.  We have been making software
systems for a relatively short time, and few are considered classics.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1025"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1026"></A>
<LI>Alexander gives an order in which his patterns should be used; we have
not.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1027"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1028"></A>
<LI>Alexander's patterns emphasize the problems they address, whereas
design patterns describe the solutions in more detail.</LI>

<A NAME="auto1029"></A>
<P></P>

<A NAME="auto1030"></A>
<LI>Alexander claims his patterns will generate complete buildings.  We do
not claim that our patterns will generate complete programs.</LI>

</OL>

<A NAME="design-poetry"></A>
<P>When Alexander claims you can design a house simply by applying his
patterns one after another, he has goals similar to those of
object-oriented design methodologists who give step-by-step rules for
design.  Alexander doesn't deny the need for creativity; some of his
patterns require understanding the living habits of the people who
will use the building, and his belief in the "poetry" of design
implies a level of expertise beyond the pattern language
itself.<A NAME="fn1"></A><A HREF="#footnote1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
But his description of how patterns
generate designs implies that a pattern language can make the design
process deterministic and repeatable.</P>

<A NAME="auto1031"></A>
<P>The Alexandrian point of view has helped us focus on design
trade-offs&#151;the different "forces" that help shape a design.  His
influence made us work harder to understand the applicability and
consequences of our patterns.  It also kept us from worrying about
defining a formal representation of patterns.  Although such a
representation might make automating patterns possible, at this stage
it's more important to explore the space of design patterns than to
formalize it.</P>

<A NAME="auto1032"></A>
<P>From Alexander's point of view, the patterns in this book do not form
a pattern language.  Given the variety of software systems that people
build, it's hard to see how we could provide a "complete" set of
patterns, one that offers step-by-step instructions for designing an
application.  We can do that for certain classes of applications, such
as report-writing or making a forms-entry system.  But our catalog is
just a collection of related patterns; we can't pretend it's a pattern
language.</P>

<A NAME="auto1033"></A>
<P>In fact, we think it's unlikely that there will <EM>ever</EM> be a
complete pattern language for software.  But it's certainly possible
to make one that is <EM>more</EM> complete.  Additions would have to
include frameworks and how to use them [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#hotdraw" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Joh92</A>], patterns for
user interface design [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#beck-johnson_ecoop94" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">BJ94</A>], analysis
patterns [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#coad_patterns" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Coa92</A>], and all the other aspects of developing
software.  Design patterns are just a part of a larger pattern
language for software.</P>

<A NAME="patt-lang-of-prog"></A>
<H3>Patterns in Software</H3>

<A NAME="anderson"></A>
<P>Our first collective experience in the study of software architecture
was at an OOPSLA '91 workshop led by Bruce Anderson.  The
workshop was dedicated to developing a handbook for software
architects.  (Judging from this book, we suspect "architecture
encyclopedia" will be a more appropriate name than "architecture
handbook.")  That first workshop has led to a series of meetings, the
most recent of which being the first conference on Pattern Languages
of Programs held in August 1994.  This has created a community of
people interested in documenting software expertise.</P>

<A NAME="knuth"></A>
<P>Of course, others have had this goal as well.  Donald Knuth's <EM>The
Art of Computer Programming</EM> [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#knuth_art" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Knu73</A>] was one of the first
attempts to catalog software knowledge, though he focused on
describing algorithms.  Even so, the task proved too great to
finish.  The <EM>Graphics Gems</EM>
series [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#graphicsGems1" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Gla90</A>, <A HREF="bibfs.htm#graphicsGems2" TARGET="_mainDisplay
Frame">Arv91</A>, <A HREF="bibfs.htm#graphicsGems3" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Kir92</A>] is another
catalog of design knowledge, though it too tends to focus on
algorithms.  The Domain Specific Software Architecture program
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#dod_dssap" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">GM92</A>]
concentrates on gathering architectural information.  The
knowledge-based software engineering community tries to represent
software-related knowledge in general.  There are many other groups
with goals at least a little like ours.</P>

<A NAME="auto1034"></A>
<P>James Coplien's <EM>Advanced C++: Programming Styles and
Idioms</EM> [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#coplien_idioms" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Cop92</A>] has influenced us, too.  The patterns in
his book tend to be more C++-specific than our design patterns, and
his book contains lots of lower-level patterns as well.  But there is
some overlap, as we point out in our patterns.  Jim has been active in
the pattern community.  He's currently working on patterns that
describe people's roles in software development organizations.</P>

<A NAME="kentbeck"></A>
<P>There are a lot of other places in which to find descriptions
of patterns.  Kent Beck was one of the first people in the software
community to advocate Christopher Alexander's work.  In 1993 he
started writing a column in <EM>The Smalltalk Report</EM> on
Smalltalk patterns.  Peter Coad has also been collecting patterns
for some time.  His paper on patterns seems to us to contain mostly
analysis patterns [<A HREF="bibfs.htm#coad_patterns" TARGET="_mainDisplayFrame">Coa92</A>];
we haven't seen his latest patterns, though we know he is still
working on them.  We've heard of several books on patterns that
are in the works, but we haven't seen any of them, either.  All we
can do is let you know they're coming.  One of these books will be
from the Pattern Languages of Programs conference.</P>

<A NAME="sec6-4"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#sec6-5"><IMG SRC="gifsb/down3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="next: A Parting Thought"></A>
An Invitation</H2>

<A NAME="auto1035"></A>
<P>What can you do if you are interested in patterns?  First, use them
and look for other patterns that fit the way you design.  
A lot of books and articles about patterns will be coming out
in the next few years,
so there will be plenty of sources for new patterns.  Develop your
vocabulary of patterns, and use it.  Use it when you talk with other
people about your designs.  Use it when you think and write about them.</P>

<A NAME="auto1036"></A>
<P>Second, be a critical consumer.  The design pattern catalog is the
result of hard work, not just ours but that of dozens of reviewers who
gave us feedback.  If you spot a problem or believe more
explanation is needed, contact us.  The same goes for any other catalog of
patterns:  Give the authors feedback!  One of the great things about
patterns is that they move design decisions out of the realm of vague
intuition.  They let authors be explicit about the trade-offs they
make.  This makes it easier to see what is wrong with their patterns
and to argue with them.  Take advantage of that.</P>

<A NAME="auto1037"></A>
<P>Third, look for patterns you use, and write them down.  Make them a
part of your documentation.  Show them to other people.  You don't
have to be in a research lab to find patterns.  In fact, finding
relevant patterns is nearly impossible if you don't have practical
experience.  Feel free to write your own catalog of patterns...but
make sure someone else helps you beat them into shape!</P>

<P>The best designs will use many design patterns that dovetail and
intertwine to produce a greater whole. As Christopher Alexander says:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is possible to make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a
rather loose way. A building made like this, is an assembly of
patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound. But it is also possible
to put patterns together in such a way that many patterns overlap in
the same physical space: the building is very dense; it has many
meanings captured in a small space; and through this density, it
becomes profound.
