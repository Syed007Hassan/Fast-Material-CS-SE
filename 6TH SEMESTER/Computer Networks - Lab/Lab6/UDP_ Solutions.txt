Assalaam-o-Alaikum
I am Muhammad Nadeem Ghouri

Today we will discuss Lab Session 06 Wireshark Labs: HTTP/S - DNS - TCP - UDP

In this lecture we discuss 
Objective:
Network traffic analysis of UDP protocol using Wireshark





Hold 30 seconds, then stop capturing.

Search UDP



 1. Four - 4 Header Fields.














2. Each Field Size is Two - 2 bytes.
User Datagram Protocol

i.  Source    -            2 bytes
ii. Destination   -     2 bytes
iii. Length   -           2 bytes
iv Checksum  -       2 bytes













3. The value in the length is the sum of the 8 heade bytes.








4. Here, The largest possiable source port number is (2 power 16 - 1) = 65535.
    And the header bytes is 8 bytes. So the maximum number of bytes that can be included in a UDP
    payload is = 65535 - 8 = 65527 bytes.









5. The largest possible source port number is (2 power 16 - 1) = 65535.













6. Decimal 17
and Hexadecimal 11.






7. Send Packet 



and Reply Packet.












Thank you :)
