The University of Toronto has several departments.  Each department is managed by a chair, and at least one professor.  Professors must be assigned to one, but possibly more departments.  At least one professor teaches each course, but a professor may be on sabbatical and not teach any course.  Each course may be taught more than once by different professors.
