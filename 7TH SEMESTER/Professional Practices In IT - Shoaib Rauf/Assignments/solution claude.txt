Here are the solutions to the assignment questions referring to the relevant paragraphs in the case study:

1. According to paragraph 1, registering as a sole proprietorship allows the 4 graduates to quickly and easily set up the business with minimal legal requirements. However, as a sole proprietorship, they would each be personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business, which poses a risk if the business fails. They may want to consider forming an LLC which provides liability protection while allowing pass-through taxation like a sole proprietorship. [Paragraph 1]

2. As stated in paragraph 1, Mr. Ahmed originally registered the company as a sole proprietorship under his name. With the addition of an employee, it introduces potential liability risks for Mr. Ahmed personally. Forming an LLC or corporation would help protect his personal assets from any claims related to the business or employee. [Paragraph 1]

3. Paragraph 1 states they formed a partnership. To allow partners to leave, they should have a partnership agreement defining an exit strategy. This provides terms for buying out a partner's share, bringing in a new partner, dissolving the partnership, etc. This gives partners flexibility to exit under agreed terms. [Paragraph 1]

4. According to paragraph 2, Mr. Ahmed did not welcome arguments from his team members. Paragraph 3 notes that diversity brings different perspectives. Stifling healthy debate from diverse views can limit innovation and problem-solving. Welcoming diverse views allows exploring challenges more thoroughly. [Paragraphs 2-3]

5. Paragraph 2 states plans to scale the team to 200 employees next year. As the sole decision maker, Mr. Ahmed's workload would increase substantially with a larger team. Promoting leadership roles and empowering employees would alleviate this burden and enable growth. [Paragraph 2] 

6. Paragraph 3 notes that diversity brings different perspectives, backgrounds, skills, and experiences. This can enhance problem-solving, innovation, and responsiveness to different customer needs. A diverse workforce can also improve company culture and recruitment. [Paragraph 3]

7. Paragraph 3 states that shared values unify employees behind a common purpose. Values like integrity, excellence, respect, etc. provide guiding principles for employee conduct and decision making. Shared values build an ethical, inclusive culture. [Paragraph 3]

8. The BCS Code of Conduct emphasizes respecting diversity of views, equal opportunity, and collaborative working. Mr. Ahmed violating this by not welcoming diverse perspectives (paragraph 2) and controlling all decisions (paragraph 3). To align with the code, he should welcome diverse views, empower employees in decision-making, and create an ethical, inclusive culture. [Paragraphs 2-3]
