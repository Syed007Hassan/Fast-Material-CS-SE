Criminals who alter or destroy such information can be dealt with by,

2. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 section 3

## Unauthorized Destruction Of Information

The law on Criminal Damage seems to apply to physically stored data for example,

1. Damage or delete data belonging to someone
2. Writing a program that damages the data on a hard disk

## Reasons For Cyber Crime Not Being Reported

- Offences are difficult to prove
- Evidences are difficult to collect - firms usually do not cooperate with the police
- Firms are embarrassed or scared about their reputation due to hacking particularly banks
- Employees are normally sacked or demoted
- Police lack expertise; time; money
- The Cyber-Crime is perceived as ‘soft crime’, as no one gets physically injured or hurt

## Current Situation

1. Hacking has increased with time
2. Few high profile cases
3. No equivalent legislation in other countries
4. Some 'international task forces' set up but no real progress
