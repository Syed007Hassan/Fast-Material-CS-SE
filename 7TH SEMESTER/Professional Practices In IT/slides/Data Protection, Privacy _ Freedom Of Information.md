## How Can The Data Protection Act Help Us?

- It gives u the right to see our files
- It says those who record and use personal information must be open about how the information is used
- It must follow the 8 principles of `good information handling`

## Main Principles Of The 1998 Act

- Personal data must be,
  1. Fairly and lawfully processed
  2. Processed for limited purposes
  3. Adequate, relevant and not excessive
  4. Accurate not kept for longer than is necessary
  5. Processed in line with your rights
  6. Held securely
  7. Measures shall be taken against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data & against accidental loss or damage
  8. Transferred to countries with adequate data protection

(FPAAPHMT)

## Data Protection Principle

### First

Personal Data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and in particular shall not be processed unless,

1. At least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met
2. In case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met

### Second

"Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purposes or those purposes."

Data controllers must notify the Information Commissioner of the personal data that they are collecting and the purposes for which it is being collected.

### Third

"Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed."

Many violations of this principle are due to ignorance rather than to intent to behave in a way contrary to the Act.

Local government has a bad record of compliance with this principle, for example sops that demand to know customers' addresses when goods are not being delivered are also likely to be in breach of this principle.

### Fourth

"Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date."

While this principle is admirable, it can be extremely difficult to comply with.

### Fifth

"Personal Data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or purposes."

This principle raises more difficulties than might be expected.

### Sixth

"Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under this Act."

Right to know whether a data controller held data relating to them, the right to see the data, and the right to have te data erased or corrected if it is inaccurate.

### Seventh

"Appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be taken against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data."

### Eight

"Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data."

## Rights Of Data Subjects

The 1998 Act extends this right of access so that data subjects have the right to receive,

1. A description of the personal data being held
2. An explanation of the purpose for which it is being held and processed
3. A description of the people or organizations to which it may be disclosed
4. An intelligible statement of the specific data held about them
5. A description of the source of the data

## Data Protection Act, Pakistan

  - To establish facts, for example, on what date a specific order was placed
  - To ensure that the organization's regulations and procedures are being complied with
  - To ascertain or demonstrate standards which are or ought to be achieved
  - To prevent or detect crime (whether computer-related or not)

  - To find out whether a communication is a business communication or a private one
  - To monitor (but not record) calls to confidential, counselling helplines run free of charge by the business

### Freedom Of Information
