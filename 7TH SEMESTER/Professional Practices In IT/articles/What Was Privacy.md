## Why Privacy Matters

One might conclude that privacy divides the world into optimists and pessimists.

Optimists trust that their information will be treated responsibly and with sensitivity; pessimists expect to be attacked by unethical or exploitative sharks.

That notion points us back to David Weinberger. Privacy is less a matter of exerting control over our information than of expecting society to continually evolve solutions that allow us to live together in a more or less civilized state.

Privacy matters because the social fabric depends on it to a great extent.

Optimists expect reasonable norms to emerge naturally; pessimists may demand legal or regulatory solutions.

If businesses are perceived - either individually or monolithically - as disregarding reasonable norms, customers will notice and react.
