Overload the following UNARY operators:
-- (prefix and postfix implementation)
* (dereferencing operator)
- (negation)
+ (unary positivie operator)
Construct a C++ program where a single GLOBAL OPERATOR FUNCTION would have been working with more than on class (for UNARY OPERATOR).
Construct a C++ program where some comparison operators would have been overloaded, your program must have GLOBAL implementation for operator functions.
By exploring C++ library on your PC, find and write down all the overloaded operators for STRING class. Elaborate the functionalities of each overloaded operator, also insert the operator functions.
Construct the programs for overloading (both through GLOBAL FUNCTION and MEMBER FUNCTION) the following binary arithmetic operators:
 + (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulo)
